They can also induce long-range entanglement between\nunmeasured qubits. However, when post-measurement states depend on many\nnon-deterministic measurement outcomes, there is a barrier to observing and\nusing the entanglement induced by prior measurements. Here we demonstrate a new\napproach for detecting such measurement-induced entanglement. We create\nshort-range entangled states of one- and two-dimensional arrays of qubits in a\nsuperconducting quantum processor, and aim to characterize the long-range\nentanglement induced between distant pairs of qubits when we measure all of the\nothers. To do this we use unsupervised training of neural networks on\nobservations to create computational models for post-measurement states and, by\ncorrelating these models with experimental data, we reveal measurement-induced\nentanglement. Our results additionally demonstrate a transition in the ability\nof a classical agent to accurately model the experimental data; this is closely\nrelated to a measurement-induced phase transition. We anticipate that our work\ncan act as a basis for future experiments on quantum error correction and more\ngeneral problems in quantum control."}

Moreover, we analyze the trade-off between the cost of\ndescribing the layout of local gates and the cost of programming them to the\ntargeted unitaries via the light-cone argument. Our findings suggest that\nfaithful gate-wise programming is optimal in the low-depth regime."}

While large-scale\nquantum computers are constrained by technological and financial barriers, a\nmodular approach that clusters small quantum computers offers an alternative.\nThis approach, however, introduces new challenges in network scalability,\nentanglement generation, and quantum memory management. In this paper, we\npropose a three-layer fat-tree network architecture for QDCs, designed to\naddress these challenges. Our architecture features a unique leaf switch and an\nadvanced swapping spine switch design, optimized to handle high volumes of\nentanglement requests as well as a queue scheduling mechanism that efficiently\nmanages quantum memory to prevent decoherence. Through queuing-theoretical\nmodels and simulations in NetSquid, we demonstrate the proposed architecture's\nscalability and effectiveness in maintaining high entanglement fidelity,\noffering a practical path forward for modular QDC networks."}
