To\novercome these challenges, we propose a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Neural\nNetwork (HQCNN) for both binary and multi-class classification. The\narchitecture of HQCNN integrates a five-layer classical convolutional backbone\nwith a 4-qubit variational quantum circuit that incorporates quantum state\nencoding, superpositional entanglement, and a Fourier-inspired quantum\nattention mechanism. We evaluate the model on six MedMNIST v2 benchmark\ndatasets. The HQCNN consistently outperforms classical and quantum baselines,\nachieving up to 99.91% accuracy and 100.00% AUC on PathMNIST (binary) and\n99.95% accuracy on OrganAMNIST (multi-class) with strong robustness on noisy\ndatasets like BreastMNIST (87.18% accuracy). The model demonstrates superior\ngeneralization capability and computational efficiency, accomplished with\nsignificantly fewer trainable parameters, making it suitable for data-scarce\nscenarios. Our findings provide strong empirical evidence that hybrid\nquantum-classical models can advance medical imaging tasks."}

Arising from destructive interference\nprocesses, they are best seen in a Tavis-Cummings-like setup where two-level\natoms (or qubits) are placed within a lossy cavity. If the system is\ninitialized with some qubits excited and some in the ground state, there is a\nnon-zero probability that no photons will be emitted. This can be framed as a\nStern-Gerlach measurement, with a detector to measure if one or more photons\nleave the cavity. If no photons are detected, the qubits collapse onto a dark\nstate. This can be viewed as heralding of a dark state based on zero photon\ndetection. Building upon this idea, we propose a protocol to measure the number\nof independent dark states. Moreover, we show that this quantity is robust to\narbitrary levels of disorder in the qubit-photon coupling constants.

In this work, we explore a generalized\nmeasurement setup in a system without intrinsic unitary dynamics and show that\nvolume-law entangled states can be generated through local, non-random, yet\nnon-commuting measurements. Specifically, we construct a one-dimensional model\ncomprising a main fermionic chain and an auxiliary (ancilla) chain, where\ngeneralized measurements are performed by locally coupling the system to\ndetector qubits. Our results demonstrate that long-time states with volume-law\nentanglement or mutual information are generated between different parts of the\nmain chain purely through non-unitary measurement dynamics.

To assess\nthis potential, we investigate the quantum precision limits for sensing\nmagnetic moments with free-electron probes. Using a scattering model where an\nelectron wavepacket interacts with a localized spin, we study two metrological\ntasks: estimating the magnitude of the magnetic moment and discriminating the\npresence of a spin. The sensitivity for a given measurement setting is\ngenerally determined by the classical Fisher information, which we benchmark\nagainst the quantum bound optimized over all measurements. We find that\nconventional TEM imaging can saturate the quantum bound when backaction of the\nprobe electron onto the spin state is negligible. We also find that, when\nbackaction is relevant, one could do better by realizing a measurement of the\nelectron's orbital angular momentum state. These results establish the quantum\nlimits of spin sensing in TEM and guide the development of future experiments\nprobing individual electron spins or nanoscale ensembles of nuclear spins."}

In this work, we study how\nmagnetic field and temperature affect the performance of a KI-TWPA based on a\nthin-NbTiN inverse microstrip with a Nb ground plane. This KI-TWPA can provide\nsubstantial signal-to-noise ratio improvement ($\\Delta SNR$) up to in-plane\nmagnetic fields of 0.35T and out-of-plane fields of 50mT, considerably higher\nthan what has been demonstrated with TWPAs based on Josephson junctions. The\nfield compatibility can be further improved by incorporating vortex traps and\nby using materials with higher critical fields. We also find that the gain does\nnot degrade when the temperature is raised to 3K (limited by the Nb ground\nplane) while $\\Delta SNR$ decreases with temperature consistently with\nexpectation. This demonstrates that KI-TWPAs can be used in experiments that\nneed to be performed at relatively high temperatures. The operability of\nKI-TWPAs in high magnetic field opens the door to a wide range of applications\nin spin qubits, spin ensembles, topological qubits, low-power NMR, and the\nsearch for axion dark matter."}

This work develops Riemannian optimization\nmethods to establish significantly tighter, computable two-sided bounds on\nthese fundamental quantities. For upper bounds, our method systematically\nsearches for state and channel extensions that minimize known\ninformation-theoretic bounds. We achieve this by parameterizing the space of\nall possible extensions as a Stiefel manifold, enabling a universal search that\novercomes the limitations of ad-hoc constructions. Combined with an improved\nupper bound on the one-way distillable entanglement based on a refined\ncontinuity bound on quantum conditional entropy, our approach yields new\nstate-of-the-art upper bounds on the quantum capacity of the qubit depolarizing\nchannel for large values of the depolarizing parameter, strictly improving the\npreviously best-known bounds. For lower bounds, we introduce Riemannian\noptimization methods to compute multi-shot coherent information. We establish\nlower bounds on the one-way distillable entanglement by parameterizing quantum\ninstruments on the unitary manifold, and on the quantum capacity by\nparameterizing code states with a product of unitary manifolds. Numerical\nresults for noisy entangled states and different channels demonstrate that our\nmethods successfully unlock superadditive gains, improving previous results.\nTogether, these findings establish Riemannian optimization as a principled and\npowerful tool for navigating the complex landscape of quantum communication\nlimits. Furthermore, we prove that amortization does not enhance the channel\ncoherent information, thereby closing a potential avenue for improving capacity\nlower bounds in general."}

To address these challenges, here we propose\na deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive\nparameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of\nHamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.\nThe motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of\nparameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics.
