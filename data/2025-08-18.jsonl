Furthermore, our\nconstruction of PRUs in constant-depth with many-qubit TOFFOLI gates shows\nthat, under cryptographic assumptions, there is no polynomial-time learning\nalgorithm for the circuit class $\\mathsf{QAC}^0$. Finally, our results suggest\na new approach towards proving that PARITY is not computable in\n$\\mathsf{QAC}^0$, a long-standing question in quantum complexity theory."}

We consider a two-qubit SWAP heat\nengine whose working medium consists of inertially moving Unruh-DeWitt qubit\ndetectors, each coupled to a scalar quantum field in thermal equilibrium at a\ndistinct temperature. Relativistic motion causes the qubits to perceive\nfrequency-dependent effective temperatures that are either hotter or colder\nthan their respective reservoir temperature. We show that the relativistic\ntemperature shift, perhaps the qubit velocity, can be harnessed as a\nthermodynamic resource to enhance the work output and the efficiency at maximum\npower of the heat engine. We derive a generalized second law for a heat engine\nwith a moving working medium and demonstrate that it can exceed the standard\nCarnot bound defined by rest-frame temperatures."}

The recoherence/decoherence events (RDE), occurring\nat the initial stage of the system evolution, are found to be both similar and\ndifferent from the system dynamics at large times. For instance, in contrast to\nthe RDE observed on large time scales, the sub-Ohmic and Ohmic coupling regimes\nare more favourable for the short-time recoherence than the super-Ohmic one. On\nthe other hand, the short-time behaviour of the recoherence and the long-time\ndynamics of the decoherence are closely related: the domain of the ohmicity\nindexes, where the decoherence changes its type (from the complete to\nincomplete one), is, simultaneously, that of the weakest recoherence. The\nobtained results give us some hints about the basic characteristics of the\nenvironment, which might provide the most optimal values of $t^*$ and\n$\\gamma_{\\rm extr}$ in some sense."}

Due to strong neutrino self-interactions in\nthese environments, there is prevalence of flavour swapping. Considering these\nenvironments to be isotropic and homogeneous, we present a study of collective\nneutrino oscillations by simulating such a system on a noisy quantum simulator\n(Qiskit AerSimulator) and a quantum processor (ibm\\_brisbane). We model the\neffective Hamiltonian governing neutrino interactions and by applying the\nTrotter-Suzuki approximation, decompose it into a tractable form suitable for\nquantum circuit implementation of the time-evolution propagator. Encoding the\nneutrino state for a system of two- and three-neutrinos onto qubits, we compute\nthe time evolution of the inversion probability relative to the initial product\nstate. Furthermore, we present quantum circuits to evaluate the concurrence as\na measure of entanglement between the neutrinos."}
