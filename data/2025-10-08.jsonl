Formulating these problems for execution on qubit-based\nquantum hardware requires mapping the qudit Hilbert space to that of multiqubit\nwhich may be exponentially larger. To exclude the infeasible subspace, one\ncommon approach relies on penalizing the objective function. However, this\nstrategy can be inefficient as the size of the illegitimate subspace grows.\nHere we propose to employ the Hamiltonian-based quantum approximate\noptimization algorithm (QAOA) through devising appropriate mixing Hamiltonians\nsuch that the infeasible configuration space is ruled out. We investigate this\nidea by employing binary, symmetric, and unary mapping techniques. It is shown\nthat the standard mixing Hamiltonian (sum of the bit-flip operations) is the\noptimal option for symmetric mapping, where the controlled-NOT gate count is\nused as a measure of implementation cost. In contrast, the other two encoding\nschemes witness a $p$-fold increase in this figure for a $p$-layer QAOA. We\napply this framework to quantum approximate thermalization and find the ground\nstate of the repulsive Bose-Hubbard model in the strong and weak interaction\nregimes."}

The runtime of our algorithm\ndepends polynomially on the sparsity of the augmented matrix $H = [A,\n-\\vec{b}]$, the inverse precision, the $\\ell_2$ norm of the solution $\\vec{y} =\nA^+ \\vec{b}$, and a new instance-dependent parameter \\[ ET= \\sum_{i=1}^M p_i^2\n\\cdot d_i, \\] where $\\vec{p} = (AA^{\\top})^+ \\vec{b}$, and $d_i$ denotes the\nsquared $\\ell_2$ norm of the $i$-th row of $H$.
