The article is related to arXiv:2302.14619", "summary": "We present a novel framework for quantizing constrained quantum systems in\nwhich the processes of quantization and constraint enforcement are performed\nsimultaneously. The approach is based on an extension of the stationary action\nprinciple, incorporating an information-theoretic term arising from vacuum\nfluctuations. Constraints are included directly in the Lagrangian via Lagrange\nmultipliers, allowing the subsequent variational procedure to yield the quantum\ndynamics without ambiguity regarding the order of quantization and reduction.\nWe demonstrate the method through two examples: (i) a one-dimensional system\nwith vanishing local momentum, where the simultaneous approach produces the\ntime-independent Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation while conventional reduced and Dirac\nquantization yield only trivial states, and (ii) a bipartite system with global\ntranslational invariance, where all three methods agree. These results show\nthat the proposed framework generalizes standard quantization schemes and\nprovides a consistent treatment of systems with constraints that cannot be\nexpressed as linear operators acting on the wave function. In addition to a\nunified variational principle for constrained quantum systems, the formalism\nalso offers an information-theoretic perspective on quantum effects arising\nfrom vacuum fluctuations."}

It may\ntherefore be possible to maintain local causality by rejecting one of these\nother assumptions instead. One possibility that has recently received\nsignificant attention involves rejecting the principle of statistical\nindependence (SI). In this paper, we consider the frequency interpretation of\nSI, which states that $\\rho(\\lambda) \\approx \\rho(\\lambda | Z)$, where\n$\\rho(\\lambda)$ is the relative frequency of an element of an ensemble being in\nthe state $\\lambda$, and $Z$ is a label that separates the ensemble into\napparently randomly selected sub-ensembles.

We argue that physical theories that\nsystematically violate SI should all be understood as superdeterministic. This\nperspective on SI sheds light on a number of issues that are being debated in\nthe superdeterminism literature, especially concerning its scope and\nphilosophical consequences.

In this letter, we propose a method termed\nmulti-level transversal injection (MLTI) for preparing rotation states at\narbitrary Clifford hierarchy levels, which achieves high fidelity while\nsignificantly reducing overhead compared to previous methods. Unlike the linear\ncost scaling of state distillation, the overhead of MLTI drops with Clifford\nhierarchy levels and then plateaus at higher levels, slashing the required\nspace-time volume by up to several orders of magnitude. Additionally, we\nintroduce a method for eliminating the off-diagonal terms of rotation states\nwithout extra overhead, unifying the metrics of infidelity and trace distance.\nThese results render the overhead for high-precision rotation gates no longer\nprohibitive, and thus bring the broad adoption of large-scale quantum\nalgorithms a critical step closer to reality."}

Floquet codes are a class of\ndynamically generated, stabilizer-based codes in which low-weight parity\nmeasurements are applied in a time-periodic schedule. Furthermore, for several\nFloquet codes, the encoding rate becomes finite even for an infinitely large\nqubit number. However, despite these advantageous properties, existing Floquet\ncodes require handling more intricate, often hypergraph-structured syndromes\nfrom the decoding perspective, which makes decoding comparatively demanding. We\ngive a concrete method for solving this issue by proposing hyperbolic color\nFloquet (HCF) code. To this end, we simultaneously take advantage of hyperbolic\nFloquet and Floquet color codes. Parity measurements in our code consist of the\nrepetitions of six-step measurements on (semi-)hyperbolic three-colorable\ntilings. Since each step just measures $X \\otimes X$ or $Z \\otimes Z$, our code\non the regular $\\{8,3\\}$ lattice has the following three advantages: (i) parity\nmeasurements are weight-2, (ii) for the numbers $k$ and $n$ of logical and\nphysical qubits, respectively, the encoding rate is finite, i.e., $\\lim_{n \\to\n\\infty} k/n = 1/8$, and (iii) the code distance is proportional to $\\log n$.\nFrom the above property, each single-fault event generally affects at most two\ndetectors, which implies ``graph-edge'' syndromes, and hence decoding with a\nminimum-weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder is efficient and virtually\nscales near-linearly in the number of physical qubits $n$. This is a stark\ncontrast to several known Floquet codes because their parity measurements\nrepeat the measurements of $X\\!\\otimes\\!X$, $Y\\!\\otimes\\!Y$, and\n$Z\\!\\otimes\\!Z$, and thus the syndromes are represented as a hypergraph, which\nbasically requires decoders with longer decoding time."}

However,\nlimited availability of available storage in such quantum repeaters and the\nimpact on the time spent within the memory unit presents a trade-off between\nquantum information fidelity (a metric that quantifies the degree of similarity\nbetween a pair of quantum states) and qubit transmission rate. Thus, effective\nmanagement of storage time for qubits becomes a key consideration in multi-hop\nquantum networks. To address these challenges, we propose Q-REACH, which\nleverages queuing theory in caching networks to tune qubit transmission rate\nwhile considering fidelity as the cost metric.

In this work, we present a unified\nquantum framework for accelerating a broad class of regression tasks --\nincluding linear and multiple regression, Lasso, Ridge, Huber, $\\ell_p$-, and\n$\\delta_p$-type regressions -- achieving up to a quadratic improvement in the\nnumber of samples $m$ over the best classical algorithms. This speedup is\nachieved by extending the recent classical breakthrough of Jambulapati et al.\n(STOC'24) using several quantum techniques, including quantum leverage score\napproximation (Apers &Gribling, 2024) and the preparation of many copies of a\nquantum state (Hamoudi, 2022). For problems of dimension $n$, sparsity $r < n$,\nand error parameter $\\epsilon$, our algorithm solves the problem in\n$\\widetilde{O}(r\\sqrt{mn}/\\epsilon + \\mathrm{poly}(n,1/\\epsilon))$ quantum\ntime, demonstrating both the applicability and the efficiency of quantum\ncomputing in accelerating regression tasks."}

In a\nrecent paper, Chailloux and Tillich proved that when we have a noise following\na Bernoulli distribution, the quantum decoding problem can be solved in\npolynomial time and is therefore easier than classical decoding for which the\nbest known algorithms have an exponential complexity. They also give an\ninformation theoretic limit for the code rate at which this problem can be\nsolved which turns out to be above the Shannon limit.\n  In this paper, we generalize the last result to all memoryless noise models.\nWe also show similar results in the rank metric case which corresponds to a\nnoise model which is not memoryless. We analyze the Pretty Good Measurement,\nfrom which we derive an information theoretic limit for this problem. By using\nthe algorithm for the quantum decoding problem together with Regev's reduction,\nwe derive a quantum algorithm sampling codewords from the dual code according\nto a probability distribution which is the dual of the original noise. It turns\nout that at the information theoretic limit, we get the most likely nonzero\ncodeword of the dual code.

Both the\nelectromagnetic fields that drive the transitions and generate superpositions,\nwhile propagating through spacetime, as well as the atoms themselves as massive\nparticles are influenced by gravitational waves, leading to effective\npotentials that induce phase differences inferred by the sensor. In this work,\nwe analyze the effects of these potentials on atomic clocks and atom\ninterferometers in the laboratory frame. We show that spatial superpositions in\natom interferometers, both light-pulse and guided ones, give rise to a\ngravitational-wave signal. Although these spatial superpositions are suppressed\nfor clocks, we show that the light pulses driving internal transitions measure\nthe spatial distance between the centers of two separate clocks. We highlight\nthat this mechanism only yields a sensitivity if both clocks, including\npossible trapping setups, move on geodesics given by the gravitational wave.\nWhile such configurations are natural for satellite free-fliers, terrestrial\noptical clocks normally rely on stationary traps, rendering them insensitive to\nleading order.

By\nemploying a one-dimensional spin-1/2 model coupled to baths via dephasing and\namplitude-damping noise, we demonstrate that correlations in reservoirs can\nsignificantly enhance battery's performance compared to local noise. In the\ndephasing scenario, we prove that correlated reservoirs produce a finite amount\nof extractable work, or ergotropy, during the transient regime when a two-cell\nbattery is initialized in a product state while local noise yields vanishing\nergotropy at all times, despite nonvanishing stored energy in both cases.\nNumerical simulations confirm that this advantage persists across larger system\nsizes and for both entangled and product initial states. We also find that the\ndynamics of quantum coherence closely mirror those of ergotropy, highlighting\ncoherence as a key resource underlying the enhanced performance of quantum\nbatteries. Further, we observe that the fraction of stored energy extracted\nfrom quantum batteries displays a sharper contrast between the correlated and\nlocal reservoirs. Moreover, for dephasing noise, this fraction remains\nindependent of system size, whereas in the amplitude damping case, it exhibits\na clear system-size dependence within the transient regime, highlighting\ndistinct operational behaviors under different noise models.
