We show that\nquantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable\ndependencies that challenge existing approaches.

However, most\ncurrent approaches use fixed entanglement topologies that are not adaptive to\ntask requirements, limiting potential gains over classical models. We introduce\na novel stochastic entanglement configuration method that systematically\ngenerates diverse entanglement topologies to identify a subspace of\nconstructive entanglement configurations, defined as entanglement topologies\nthat boost hybrid model performance (e.g., classification accuracy) beyond\nclassical baselines. Each configuration is encoded as a stochastic binary\nmatrix, denoting directed entanglement between qubits. This enables scalable\nexploration of the hyperspace of candidate entanglement topologies using\nentanglement density and per-qubit constraints as key metrics. We define\nunconstrained and constrained sampling modes, controlling entanglement per\nqubit. Using our method, 400 stochastic configurations were generated and\nevaluated in a hybrid QML for cardiac MRI disease classification. We identified\n64 (16%) novel constructive entanglement configurations that consistently\noutperformed the classical baseline. Ensemble aggregation of top-performing\nconfigurations achieved ~0.92 classification accuracy, exceeding the classical\nmodel (~0.87) by over 5%. Compared to four conventional topologies (ring,\nnearest neighbor, no entanglement, fully entangled), none surpassed the\nclassical baseline (maximum accuracy ~0.82), while our configurations delivered\nup to ~20% higher accuracy. Thus, highlighting the robustness and\ngeneralizability of the identified constructive entanglements."}

Using Von Neumann entropy as our\nmeasure, we derive precise mathematical relationships for maximum entanglement\nin graph states as a function of qubit number.

Conventional\ndecoders designed for worst-case error scenarios incur significant overhead,\nprompting the development of local decoders, that leverage the sparse and often\ntrivial nature of many quantum errors, to support the conventional decoders.\nThe previously proposed Clique decoder addresses this by handling isolated,\nlength-1 space and time errors within the cryogenic environment with minimal\nhardware costs, thereby mitigating I/O bandwidth constraints between cryogenic\nquantum systems and room-temperature processors. Building on this foundation,\nwe propose Clique_L2 that extends the Clique-based approach by relaxing some\noriginal constraints and incorporating additional low-cost logic to also\ncorrect length-2 error chains in space, which become non-trivial occurrences at\nhigher physical error rates and code distances. This enhanced capability not\nonly further reduces out-of-the-fridge data transmission but also adapts more\neffectively to clustered errors observed under a variety of noise models.\nSpecifically, under data-qubit-only errors and uniformly random noise,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 8.95x decoding bandwidth reduction over the original\nClique (or Clique_L1) decoder, especially beneficial at higher code distances.\nWhen clustered errors and longer error chains are more likely to occur,\nClique_L2 achieves up to 18.3x decoding bandwidth reduction over Clique_L1,\nachieving substantial benefits across a wide range of physical qubit error\nrates."}
