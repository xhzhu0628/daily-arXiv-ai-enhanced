This move deliberately sidesteps\nthe assumption of context-independent values for incompatible observables. Our\nupdated version of the Reality Criterion works like this: if Alice measures\nobservable x and obtains outcome a, then Bob's system must adopt a conditional\nstate that ensures the corresponding outcome for that specific context.\nCrucially, we also assume operational completeness - a condition that quantum\nmechanics satisfies when we're dealing with quantum-reachable assemblages. Now,\nin any theory where one party cannot signal to the other (so-called one-sided\nno-signaling theories), perfect predictions do support drawing context-indexed\ninferences. But - and this is key - they don't legitimize assigning fixed\nvalues across all contexts. We rigorously demonstrate this distinction.

In our formulation, an accuracy-confidence target is evaluated via a\nrun-based sequential test that halts after a prescribed number of consecutive\nvalidations, and a closed-form budget bound guarantees the learning success if\nthe data-path channel is admissible; the acceptance must also exceed a\nprimitive random-search baseline. We elevate and complete our secure-learning\nconstruction in the context of quantum information -- establishing\nquantum-secure PAC learning: for prepare-and-measure scenarios, the data-path\nadmissibility is set to be threshold fixed by Holevo information, not a\nlearner-tunable tolerance. Thus, a certified information advantage for the\nlearner directly becomes the learning security -- an effect with no classical\nanalogue. The channel-determined confidence follows naturally and basis sifting\nis incorporated for practical deployments.

Each agent operates as a finite transverse-field Ising\nsubsystem, maintaining internal quantum coherence while interacting through\nstate-dependent feedback channels characterised by reduced observables such as\nspin polarisation, bond correlation, and internal energy. These informational\ncouplings enable the transformation of a static lattice into a\nfeedback-reconfigurable medium. The effective Hamiltonian generated, which\nremains Hermitian at each iteration, is resolved self-consistently using a\nmean-field approximation, where the feedback fields are iteratively adjusted to\nminimise the total energy. Numerical investigations identify three distinct\nregimes: domain formation near the feedback--fluctuation critical point,\nglass-like frustration due to competing feedback channels, and modular\npolarisation sustained by structured interactions. These phenomena occur\nindependently of geometric embedding, illustrating that informational\nsimilarity alone can induce coherent organisation.
