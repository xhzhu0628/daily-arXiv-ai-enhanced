*Mobin Motaharifar,Mahmood Hasani,Hassan Kaatuzian*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: CV-QKD是一种更实用的量子密钥分发方法，兼容现有电信基础设施，结合光子集成电路和机器学习优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索CV-QKD的理论基础、技术进步和实际挑战，推动大规模量子安全网络的部署。

Result: 结合量子光子集成和机器学习，提高了CV-QKD的效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CV-QKD及其相关技术的发展为大规模、高速量子安全网络的实用部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) represents a cornerstone of secure
communication in the quantum era. While discrete-variable QKD (DV-QKD)
protocols were historically the first to demonstrate secure key exchange,
continuous-variable QKD (CV-QKD) has emerged as a more practical alternative
due to its seamless compatibility with current telecommunications
infrastructure. CV-QKD relies on coherent and squeezed states of light,
offering significant advantages for integration into modern optical networks.
This review comprehensively explores the theoretical underpinnings,
technological advancements, and practical challenges of CV-QKD. Special
attention is given to the role of photonic integrated circuits (PICs) in
enabling scalable and efficient implementation of CV-QKD systems. Furthermore,
recent advances in machine learning have been leveraged to optimize CV-QKD
performance, with data-driven techniques enhancing noise estimation, parameter
optimization, and system security. Additionally, tensor networks provide
efficient computational tools for analyzing complex quantum correlations,
improving the efficiency and robustness of quantum key distribution protocols.
These developments, combined with ongoing improvements in quantum photonic
integration, pave the way for the practical deployment of large-scale,
high-speed quantum-secure networks.

### [2] [Consistent Simulation of Fibonacci Anyon Braiding within a Qubit Quasicrystal Inflation Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21643)
*Marcelo M. Amaral*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一维准晶膨胀码（QIC）的框架，用于模拟非阿贝尔任意子编织，并展示了其可扩展性和物理可实现性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 模拟非阿贝尔任意子编织是实现容错量子计算的关键步骤。

Result: 通过实验验证了框架的有效性，并在IBM量子处理器上成功执行了编织算法。

Conclusion: 该工作为可扩展的任意子编织模拟提供了验证和物理基础。

Abstract: The simulation of non-Abelian anyon braiding is a critical step towards
fault-tolerant quantum computation. We introduce a framework for this task
based on a one-dimensional Quasicrystal Inflation Code (QIC). The code is
defined by a local Hamiltonian whose ground state manifold enforces Fibonacci
tiling constraints and possesses the correct Fibonacci degeneracy. We derive
the corresponding braid operators and demonstrate that, while they are formally
non-local, they possess an exact, local 3-qubit structure. This allows us to
distill their action into a single, physically realizable $8 \times 8$ gate,
which we term the $B_{gate}$. We prove through comparative compilation for
systems with different numbers of qubits that constructing circuits by
composing these local gates is dramatically more scalable than compiling the
equivalent global unitary, showing a greater than tenfold reduction in circuit
depth. To validate the framework, we successfully executed a braiding algorithm
for the Jones polynomial, a topological invariant of knots, on an IBM Quantum
processor, quantifying the signal degradation due to hardware noise. Finally,
we numerically confirm for systems up to 17 qubits that our construction
rigorously satisfies the required Temperley-Lieb and braid group relations
while preserving the code subspace. This work establishes a validated and
physically grounded pathway for the scalable simulation of anyonic braiding on
programmable quantum systems.

Result: 发现纠缠衰减遵循指数规律，并确定了量子相干与经典态的阈值。

Conclusion: 研究扩展了退相干理论，为量子技术中的纠缠保护提供了定量标准。

Abstract: The resilience of quantum entanglement under irreversible,
energy-transferring interactions remains a fundamental question in quantum
foundations and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a fully microscopic
quantum electrodynamics framework to describe how spatial entanglement evolves
when one particle of an entangled pair undergoes dissipative processes such as
ionization or inelastic scattering. We show that entanglement decay follows an
exponential law governed by recoil-induced momentum diffusion and identify a
sharp operational threshold separating quantum-coherent and classical regimes.
This threshold depends on whether the cumulative recoil-induced uncertainty
exceeds the intrinsic bandwidth of the entangled state. Our results extend
decoherence theory beyond Gaussian and weak-coupling models, providing
quantitative criteria for entanglement survival in radiative environments and
informing the design of robust quantum protocols in quantum sensing, imaging,
and radiation-based quantum technologies.

Abstract: We introduce a framework for computing time-dependent quantum transition
rates (QTRs) that describe the pace of evolution of a quantum state from a
given subspace to a target subspace. QTRs are expressed in terms of flux-flux
correlators and are shown to obey two complementary quantum speed limits. Our
framework readily accommodates the generalization of Hamiltonian dynamics to
arbitrary open quantum evolution, including quantum measurements. We illustrate
how QTRs can be controlled by counterdiabatic driving.

### [5] [Characterizing non-Markovianity via quantum coherence based on Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21691)

Conclusion: 基于Kirkwood-Dirac准概率相干性的方法为分析非马尔可夫动力学提供了新视角，具有实验和理论优势。

Abstract: We present a new measure of non-Markovianity based on the property of
nonincreasing quantum coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability under
incoherent completely positive trace-preserving maps. Quantum coherence via the
KD quasiprobability is defined as the imaginary part of the KD
quasiprobability, which is maximised over all possible second bases and
evaluated using an incoherent reference basis. A measure non-Markovianity based
on KD quasiprobability coherence would capture memory effects via the time
evolution of the imaginary part of the KD quasiprobability, providing an
experimentally accessible and physically intuitive alternative to traditional
measures relying on quantum Fisher information or trace distance. This approach
is applied to the study of dissipation and dephasing dynamics in single- and
two-qubit systems. The results obtained show that, in the cases studied, our
measure based on coherence via Kirkwood-Dirac quasiprobability performs at
least as well as $\ell_{1}$-norm coherence in detecting non-Markovianity, this
provides a novel perspective on the analysis of non-Markovian dynamics.

### [6] [Crosstalk-Resilient Quantum MIMO for Scalable Quantum Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21704)
*Seid Koudia,Symeon Chatzinotas*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种基于GKP编码的量子信息传输策略，解决量子多路复用中的串扰问题，确保逻辑信息完整传输。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子通信网络中串扰问题限制了吞吐量的扩展，需找到有效方法解决。

Method: 将离散变量量子信息编码到连续变量玻色模式中，利用GKP码吸收串扰干扰。

Result: 在特定噪声条件下，逻辑信息可完整传输，数值模拟验证了保真度行为。

Conclusion: 为量子网络中的抗串扰多路复用奠定了编码理论基础。

Abstract: We address the challenge of crosstalk in quantum multiplexing -an obstacle to
scaling throughput in quantum communication networks. Crosstalk arises when
physically coupled quantum modes interfere, degrading signal fidelity. We
propose a mitigation strategy based on encoding discrete-variable (DV) quantum
information into continuous-variable (CV) bosonic modes using
Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes. By analyzing the effect of mode-mixing
interference, we show that under specific noise strength conditions, the
interaction can be absorbed into a gauge subsystem that leaves the logical
content intact. We provide rigorous conditions for perfect transmission in the
ideal case, derive the structure of the output codes and prove the existence of
a gauge-fixing decoder enabling recovery of the logical information. Numerical
simulations under displacement Gaussian noise illustrate the fidelity behavior
and rate-fidelity tradeoff. Our results establish a coding-theoretic foundation
for crosstalk-resilient multiplexing in quantum networks.

Abstract: We present a protocol using machine learning (ML) to simultaneously optimize
the quantum error-correcting code space and the corresponding recovery map in
the framework of continuous-time quantum error correction. Given a Hilbert
space and a noise process -- potentially correlated across both space and time
-- the protocol identifies the optimal recovery strategy, measured by the
average logical state fidelity. This approach enables the discovery of recovery
schemes tailored to arbitrary device-level noise.

that certain combinations of cavity lifetime and light-matter coupling strength
can lead to carrier-photon correlations that increase single-photon generation
rate while maintaining low 2nd order photon correlation. This study provides
guidance for future emitter-cavity design to achieve high purity and ultrafast
single photon generation.

Conclusion: 该方法有效处理了边界条件，展示了量子算法在微分方程模拟中的潜力。

Abstract: Complicated boundary conditions are essential to accurately describe
phenomena arising in nature and engineering. Recently, the investigation of a
potential speedup through quantum algorithms in simulating the governing
ordinary and partial differential equations of such phenomena has gained
increasing attention. We design an efficient quantum algorithms for solving
differential equations with arbitrary boundary conditions. Specifically, we
propose an approach to enforce arbitrary boundary conditions and constraints
through adding a penalty projection to the governing equations. Assuming a
fast-forwardable representation of the projection to ensure an efficient
interaction picture imulation, the cost of to enforce the constraints is at
most $O(\log\lambda)$ in the strength of the penalty $\lambda$ in the gate
complexity; in the worst case, this goes as $O([\|v(0)\|^2\|A_0\| +
\|b\|_{L^1[0;t]}^2)]t^2/\varepsilon)$, for precision $\varepsilon$ and a
dynamical system $\frac{\rm d}{{\rm d}t} v(t) = A_0(t) v(t) + b(t)$ with
negative semidefinite $A_0(t)$ of size $n^d\times n^d$. E.g., for the heat
equation, this leads to a gate complexity overhead of $\widetilde O(d\log n +
\log t)$. We show constraint error bounds for the penalty approach and provide
validating numerical experiments, and estimate the circuit complexity using the
Linear Combination of Hamiltonian Simulation.

### [10] [Implementation and representation of qudit multi-controlled unitaries and hypergraph states by many-body angular momentum couplings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21831)

Conclusion: 该方法为qudit多控制酉算子的实现提供了新思路，尤其在光学系统中具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: We construct a representation of qudit multi-controlled unitary operators in
terms of many-body angular momentum interactions. The representation is
particularly convenient for odd-dimensional systems, with interesting
connections to the Pegg-Barnett phase formalism. We illustrate the main points
in the special case of qutrits, where simplifications and connections to
dipole-quadrupole and quadrupole-quadrupole interactions can be established. We
describe the representation of the closely related set of qudit hypergraph
states, identifying possible realizations and their main obstacles. Qutrit
tripartite controlled unitaries are decomposed in terms of more familiar
two-body angular momentum couplings, enabling their implementation in a variety
of physical systems. We give then a concrete example of implementation of
qutrit unitaries and hypergraph states in optical systems that employs
single-photon sources, two-mode cross-Kerr interactions and linear optical
operations. Moreover, we define a new set of states, called angular momentum
hypergraph states, which are more directly related to the angular momentum
representation.

### [11] [Adversarial Threats in Quantum Machine Learning: A Survey of Attacks and Defenses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21842)
*Archisman Ghosh,Satwik Kundu,Swaroop Ghosh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子机器学习（QML）结合量子计算与经典机器学习，但面临NISQ时代的安全挑战。本章探讨QML特有的对抗威胁及防御机制。

Result: 提出利用量子特性（如噪声签名）和经典方法（如对抗训练）来保护QML系统。

Conclusion: QML安全需平衡噪声与可靠性，未来需开发量子-经典信任框架以应对不断演变的威胁。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) integrates quantum computing with classical
machine learning, primarily to solve classification, regression and generative
tasks. However, its rapid development raises critical security challenges in
the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era. This chapter examines
adversarial threats unique to QML systems, focusing on vulnerabilities in
cloud-based deployments, hybrid architectures, and quantum generative models.
Key attack vectors include model stealing via transpilation or output
extraction, data poisoning through quantum-specific perturbations, reverse
engineering of proprietary variational quantum circuits, and backdoor attacks.
Adversaries exploit noise-prone quantum hardware and insufficiently secured
QML-as-a-Service (QMLaaS) workflows to compromise model integrity, ownership,
and functionality. Defense mechanisms leverage quantum properties to counter
these threats. Noise signatures from training hardware act as non-invasive
watermarks, while hardware-aware obfuscation techniques and ensemble strategies
disrupt cloning attempts. Emerging solutions also adapt classical adversarial
training and differential privacy to quantum settings, addressing
vulnerabilities in quantum neural networks and generative architectures.
However, securing QML requires addressing open challenges such as balancing
noise levels for reliability and security, mitigating cross-platform attacks,
and developing quantum-classical trust frameworks. This chapter summarizes
recent advances in attacks and defenses, offering a roadmap for researchers and
practitioners to build robust, trustworthy QML systems resilient to evolving
adversarial landscapes.

Abstract: Nuclear spins' dipolar order is created under magic angle spinning through
the first-order process made possible by simultaneous implementation of dipolar
recoupling and adiabatic demagnetization in a reference frame reached out
through nested transformations, firstly from the laboratory frame into the
rotating frame, and then into the spin coordinate system nutating inside its
parent frame. In such a nutating frame, both the static and resonantly rotating
radio-frequency (RF) fields are invisible, and the re-introduced dipolar
interaction provides a secular eigenstate on which dipolar order develops with
assist of an additional portion of RF field designed to implement adiabatic
demagnetization in the nutating frame.

Abstract: Weak measurements have been predicted to dramatically alter universal
properties of quantum critical wavefunctions, though experimental validation
remains an open problem. Here we devise a practical scheme for realizing
measurement-altered criticality in a chain of Rydberg atoms tuned to Ising and
tricritical Ising phase transitions. In particular, we show that projectively
measuring a periodic subset of atoms alters quantum critical correlations in
distinct ways that one can control via the choice of measured sites and the
measurement outcomes. While our protocol relies on post-selection, the
measurement outcomes yielding the most dramatic consequences occur with
surprisingly large probabilities: O(10%) with chains featuring O(100) sites.
Characterizing the proposed post-measurement states requires only an adjustment
in the post-process averaging of outcomes used to characterize unmeasured
critical states, resulting in minimal additional experimental overhead for
demonstrating measurement-altered criticality.

Result: 提供了一种方法，可以同时在两种设置下构建协议，并将现有协议从一种设置转换为另一种。

Conclusion: 研究表明两种设置并非完全独立，可以通过方法实现协议的灵活转换和构建。

Abstract: Delegated quantum computing (DQC) allows clients with low quantum
capabilities to outsource computations to a server hosting a quantum computer.
This process is typically envisioned within the measurement-based quantum
computing framework, as it naturally facilitates blindness of inputs and
computation. Hence, the overall process of setting up and conducting the
computation encompasses a sequence of three stages: preparing the qubits,
entangling the qubits to obtain the resource state, and measuring the qubits to
run the computation. There are two primary approaches to distributing these
stages between the client and the server that impose different constraints on
cryptographic techniques and experimental implementations. In the
prepare-and-send setting, the client prepares the qubits and sends them to the
server, while in the receive-and-measure setting, the client receives the
qubits from the server and measures them. Although these settings have been
extensively studied independently, their interrelation and whether
setting-dependent theoretical constraints are inevitable remain unclear. By
implementing the key components of most DQC protocols in the respective missing
setting, we provide a method to build prospective protocols in both settings
simultaneously and to translate existing protocols from one setting into the
other.

Abstract: A single excitation in a quantum spin network described by the Heisenberg
model can effect a variety of continuous-time quantum walks on unweighted
graphs, including those governed by the discrete Laplacian, adjacency matrix,
and signless Laplacian. In this paper, we show that the Heisenberg model can
effect these three quantum walks on signed weighted graphs, as well as a
generalized Laplacian equal to the discrete Laplacian plus a real-valued
multiple of the degree matrix, for which the standard Laplacian, adjacency
matrix, and signless Laplacian are special cases. We explore the algorithmic
consequence of this generalized Laplacian quantum walk when searching a
weighted barbell graph consisting of two equal-sized, unweighted cliques
connected by a single signed weighted edge or bridge, with the search oracle
constituting an external magnetic field in the spin network. We prove that
there are two weights for the bridge (which could both be positive, both
negative, or one of each, depending on the multiple of the degree matrix) that
allow amplitude to cross from one clique to the other -- except for the
standard and signless Laplacians that respectively only have one negative or
positive weight bridge -- boosting the success probability from 0.5 to 0.820 or
0.843 for each weight. Moreover, one of the weights leads to a two-stage
algorithm that further boosts the success probability to 0.996.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning framework that offers ease
of training compared to other quantum neural network models, as it does not
rely on gradient-based optimization. Learning is performed in a single step on
the output features measured from the quantum system. Various implementations
of quantum reservoir computing have been explored in simulations, with
different measured features. Although simulations have shown that quantum
reservoirs present advantages in performance compared to classical reservoirs,
experimental implementations have remained scarce. This is due to the challenge
of obtaining a large number of output features that are nonlinear
transformations of the input data. In this work, we propose and experimentally
implement a novel quantum reservoir computing platform based on a circuit
quantum electrodynamics architecture, consisting of a single cavity mode
coupled to a superconducting qubit. We obtain a large number of nonlinear
features from a single physical system by encoding the input data in the
amplitude of a coherent drive and measuring the cavity state in the Fock basis.
We demonstrate classification of two classical tasks with significantly smaller
hardware resources and fewer measured features compared to classical neural
networks. Our experimental results are supported by numerical simulations that
show additional Kerr nonlinearity is beneficial to reservoir performance. Our
work demonstrates a hardware-efficient quantum neural network implementation
that can be further scaled up and generalized to other quantum machine learning
models.

Conclusion: 通过任意子禁闭可以产生新的激发态和逻辑算符，为量子计算和拓扑序研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We introduce a modified 2D toric code Hamiltonian that exhibits explicit
anyon confinement along a single spatial direction. By bounding the motion of
these confined anyons, we obtain dipolar excitations with restricted mobility.
We analyze the resulting logical operators, whose existence depends on the
system size, as well as the structure of gapped boundaries and a tensor network
representation of the ground state. Furthermore, when confinement is enforced
in both directions, fractal-like excitations emerge, resulting in unpaired
logical operators.
  We extend our construction to 3D models, such as the surface code and the

Abstract: Gravitational interaction unavoidably influences atoms and their
electromagnetic radiation field in strong gravitational fields. Theoretical
description of such effects using the curved metric of general relativity is
limited due to the classical nature of the metric and the assumption of the
local inertial frame, where gravitational interaction is absent. Here we apply
unified gravity extension of the Standard Model [Rep. Prog. Phys. 88, 057802
(2025)] to solve the Dirac equation for hydrogen-like atoms in the 4xU(1)
gravity gauge field, which appears alongside all other quantum fields. We show
that the gravity gauge field shifts the atomic Dirac energy levels by an amount
that agrees with the experimentally observable gravitational redshift. Our
result for the redshift follows directly from quantum field theory and is
strictly independent of the metric-based explanation of general relativity.
Furthermore, we present how gravitational potential gradient breaks the
symmetry of the electric potential of the atomic nucleus, thus leading to
splitting of otherwise degenerate spectral lines in strong gravitational
fields. Enabling detailed spectral line analysis, our work opens novel
possibilities for future investigations of quantum photonics phenomena in
strong gravitational fields.

Abstract: We address the challenge of certifying quantum behavior with single
macroscopic massive particles, subject to decoherence and finite data. We
propose a hypothesis testing framework that distinguishes between classical and
quantum mechanics based on position measurements. While interference pattern
visibility in single-particle quantum superposition experiments has been
commonly used as a sufficient criterion to falsify classical mechanics, we show
that, from a hypothesis testing perspective, it is neither necessary nor
efficient. Focusing on recent proposals to prepare macroscopic superposition
states of levitated nanoparticles, we show that the likelihood ratio test --
which leverages differences across the entire probability distribution --
provides an exponential reduction in measurements needed to reach a given
confidence level. These results offer a principled, efficient method to falsify
classical mechanics in interference experiments, relaxing the experimental
constraints faced by current efforts to test quantum mechanics at the
macroscopic scale.

Conclusion: QMBS在混沌系统中具有信息传输的应用潜力。

Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) offer a mechanism for weak ergodicity
breaking, enabling non-thermal dynamics to persist in a chaotic many-body
system. While most studies of QMBS focus on anomalous eigenstate properties or
long-lived revivals of local observables, their potential for quantum
information processing remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate
that \emph{perfect quantum state transfer} can be achieved in a strongly
interacting, quantum chaotic spin chain by exploiting a sparse set of QMBS
eigenstates embedded within an otherwise thermal spectrum. These results show
that QMBS in chaotic many-body systems may be harnessed for information
transport tasks typically associated with integrable models.

Abstract: Information-theoretic quantities have received significant attention as
system-independent measures of correlations in many-body quantum systems, e.g.,
as universal order parameters of synchronization. In this work, we present a
method to determine the macroscopic behavior of the steady-state multipartite
mutual information between $N$ interacting units undergoing Markovian evolution
that is invariant under unit permutations. Using this approach, we extend a
conclusion previously drawn for classical systems that the extensive scaling of
mutual information is either not possible for systems relaxing to fixed points
of the mean-field dynamics or such scaling is not robust to perturbations of
certain system parameters. In contrast, robust extensive scaling occurs for
system relaxing to time-dependent attractors, e.g., limit cycles. We illustrate
the applicability of our method on the driven-dissipative Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick
model.

Abstract: Static electric fields have been suggested as a spin to orbital angular

required to facilitate significant conversion to longitudinal orbital angular
momentum is prohibitively high for lab power supplies. In this work we exploit
the intra-atomic nuclear electric field in the periodic structure of perfect
single crystals, specifically quartz, which can be orders of magnitude larger
than lab fields. We calculate the Bragg and Laue diffracted wavefunctions of
thermal neutrons and back-diffracted neutrons and demonstrate spin to orbital
angular momentum conversion. Finally we report on a thermal neutron Bragg
diffraction experiment from [110] quartz confirming our results.

Abstract: This paper presents methodological improvements to variational quantum
algorithms (VQAs) for solving multicriteria optimization problems. We introduce
two key contributions. First, we reformulate the parameter optimization task of
VQAs as a multicriteria problem, enabling the direct use of classical
algorithms from various multicriteria metaheuristics. This hybrid framework
outperforms the corresponding single-criteria VQAs in both average and
worst-case performance across diverse benchmark problems. Second, we propose a
method that augments the hypervolume-based cost function with coverage-oriented
indicators, allowing explicit control over the diversity of the resulting
Pareto front approximations. Experimental results show that our method can
improve coverage by up to 40\% with minimal loss in hypervolume. Our findings
highlight the potential of combining quantum variational methods with classical
population-based search to advance practical quantum optimization.

Conclusion: 非因子子系统的分区在量子理论中具有实际意义，但可能引入伪非局域性，如费米子系统中的局部模式分区所示。

Abstract: Decompositional theories describe the ways in which a global physical system
can be split into subsystems, facilitating the study of how different possible
partitions of a same system interplay, e.g. in terms of inclusions or
signalling. In quantum theory, subsystems are usually framed as sub-C* algebras
of the algebra of operators on the global system. However, most decompositional
approaches have so far restricted their scope to the case of systems
corresponding to factor algebras. We argue that this is a mistake: one should
cater for the possibility for non-factor subsystems, arising for instance from
symmetry considerations. Building on simple examples, we motivate and present a
definition of partitions into an arbitrary number of parts, each of which is a
possibly non-factor sub-C* algebra. We discuss its physical interpretation and
study its properties, in particular with regards to the structure of algebras'
centres. We prove that partitions, defined at the C*-algebraic level, can be
represented in terms of a splitting of Hilbert spaces, using the framework of
routed quantum circuits. For some partitions, however, such a representation
necessarily retains a residual pseudo-nonlocality. We provide an example of
this behaviour, given by the partition of a fermionic system into local modes.

Abstract: Understanding quantum theory's causal structure stands out as a major matter,
since it radically departs from classical notions of causality. We present
advances in the research program of causal decompositions, which investigates
the existence of an equivalence between the causal and the compositional
structures of unitary channels. Our results concern one-dimensional Quantum
Cellular Automata (1D QCAs), i.e. unitary channels over a line of $N$ quantum
systems (with or without periodic boundary conditions) that feature a causality
radius $r$: a given input cannot causally influence outputs at a distance more
than $r$. We prove that, for $N \geq 4r + 1$, 1D QCAs all admit causal
decompositions: a unitary channel is a 1D QCA if and only if it can be
decomposed into a unitary routed circuit of nearest-neighbour interactions, in
which its causal structure is compositionally obvious. This provides the first
constructive form of 1D QCAs with causality radius one or more, fully
elucidating their structure. In addition, we show that this decomposition can
be taken to be translation-invariant for the case of translation-invariant
QCAs. Our proof of these results makes use of innovative algebraic techniques,
leveraging a new framework for capturing partitions into non-factor sub-C*
algebras.

Method: 分析多参数量子态（由任意未知量子通道生成）路径的端到端纠缠，固定并发度但变化密度矩阵元素。

Result: 端到端纠缠受限于边态并发度函数；随着路径增长，纠缠分布更集中于均值；并发度低于阈值时平均纠缠消失，高于阈值时随路径长度增长更快。

Conclusion: 仅凭边态纠缠保证无法确定多参数态路径的最优纠缠分布路径。

Abstract: Long-range entanglement distribution in a quantum network relies on
entanglement swapping at intermediate nodes along a network path to connect
short-range entangled states established over the network edges. The end-to-end
entanglement of a network path obtained via this process determines the utility
of the network path for executing entanglement enabled tasks and for the design
of entanglement routing protocols in the quantum network. Here, we study the
end-to-end entanglement of paths in a quantum network when the edges are
characterised by multi-parameter quantum states that may be considered to be
the output of arbitrary and unknown quantum channels described by the network's
edges. We find that over ensembles of multi-parameter states with fixed
concurrence but varying density matrix elements, the end-to-end entanglement
takes a range of values upper bounded by a function of the concurrence of the
network-edge states. The scaling behaviour of the average end-to-end
entanglement reveals that its distribution gets increasingly concentrated
around the mean as the paths become longer. For a network path of a given
length, the average end-to-end entanglement vanishes for edge concurrence
values below a threshold that increases with the path-length. Whereas, for edge
concurrence values greater than the threshold the average end-to-end
entanglement increases faster with the length of the path. As an implication of
our results, we show that the optimal path for entanglement distribution
between a pair of end nodes, connected by alternate paths with multi-parameter
states along the edges, can be indeterminate given only entanglement guarantees
along the network edges.

Conclusion: 该算法不仅准确高效，还能促进ADAPT-VQE的收敛，展示了其广泛适用性。

Abstract: A quantum computing algorithm is proposed to obtain low-lying excited states
in many-body interacting systems. The approximate eigenstates are obtained by
using a quantum space diagonalization method in a subspace of states selected
from the convergence path of the ADAPT-VQE (adaptive derivative-assembled
pseudo-Trotter Ansatz variational quantum eigensolver) towards the ground state
of the many-body problem. This method is shown to be accurate with only a small
overhead in terms of quantum resources required to get the ground state. We
also show that the quantum algorithm might be used to facilitate the
convergence of the ADAPT-VQE method itself. Successful applications of the
technique are made to like-particle pairing as well as neutron-proton pairing.
Finally, the $H_4$ molecule's dissociation also illustrates the technique,
demonstrating its accuracy and versatility.

Abstract: Understanding the connections between different quantum information protocols
has been proven fruitful for both theoretical insights and experimental
applications. In this work, we explore the relationship between non-local and
prepare-and-measure scenarios, proposing a systematic way to translate
bipartite Bell inequalities into dimensionally-bounded prepare-and-measure
tasks. We identify sufficient conditions under which the translation preserves
the quantum bound and self-testing properties, enabling a wide range of
certification protocols originally developed for the non-local setting to be
adapted to the sequential framework of prepare-and-measure with a dimensional
bound. While the dimensionality bound is not device-independent, it still is a
practical and experimentally reasonable assumption in many cases of interest.
In some instances, we find new experimentally-friendly certification protocols.
In others, we demonstrate equivalences with already known prepare-and-measure
protocols, where self-testing results were previously established using
alternative mathematical methods. Our results unify different quantum
correlation frameworks, and contribute to the ongoing research effort of
studying the interplay between parallel and sequential protocols.

Conclusion: 通过实例验证了最优测量策略能最大化条件纯度和‘daemonic ergotropy’，为量子功提取提供了新视角。

Abstract: According to the Maxwell demon paradigm, additional work can be extracted
from a classical or quantum system by exploiting information obtained through
measurements on a correlated ancillary system. In the quantum setting, the
maximum work extractable via unitary operations in such measurement-assisted
protocols is referred to as daemonic ergotropy. In this work, we explore this
concept in the context of continuous-variable quantum systems, focusing on
Gaussian states and general-dyne (Gaussian) measurements. We derive a general
expression for the daemonic ergotropy and examine two key scenarios: (i)
bipartite Gaussian states where a general-dyne measurement is performed on one
of the two parties, and (ii) open Gaussian quantum systems under continuous
general-dyne monitoring of the environment. Remarkably, we show that for
single-mode Gaussian states, the ergotropy depends solely on the state's energy
and purity. This enables us to express the daemonic ergotropy as a simple
function of the unconditional energy and the purity of the conditional states,
revealing that enhanced daemonic work extraction is directly linked to
measurement-induced purification. We illustrate our findings through two
paradigmatic examples: extracting daemonic work from a two-mode squeezed
thermal state and from a continuously monitored optical parametric oscillator.
In both case we identify the optimal general-dyne strategies that maximize the
conditional purity and, in turn, the daemonic ergotropy.

Abstract: Quantum physics exhibits an intrinsic and private form of randomness with no
classical counterpart. Any setup for quantum randomness generation involves
measurements acting on quantum states. In this work, we consider the following
question: Given a quantum measurement, how much randomness can be generated
from it? In real life, measurements are noisy and thus contain an additional,
extrinsic form of randomness due to ignorance. This extrinsic randomness is not
private since, in an adversarial model, it takes the form of quantum side
information held by an eavesdropper who can use it to predict the measurement
outcomes. Randomness of measurements is then quantified by the guessing
probability of this eavesdropper, when minimized over all possible input
states. This optimization is in general hard to compute, but we solve it here
for any two-outcome qubit measurement and for projective measurements in
arbitrary dimension mixed with white noise. We also construct, for a given
measured probability distribution, different realizations with (i) a noisy
state and noiseless measurement (ii) a noiseless state and noisy measurement
and (iii) a noisy state and measurement, and we show that the latter gives an
eavesdropper significantly higher guessing power.

Abstract: A principal concern in the optimisation of parametrised quantum circuits is
the presence of barren plateaus, which present fundamental challenges to the
scalability of applications, such as variational algorithms and quantum machine
learning models. Recent proposals for these methods have increasingly used the
linear combination of unitaries (LCU) procedure as a core component. In this
work, we prove that an LCU of trainable parametrised circuits is still
trainable. We do so by analytically deriving the expression for the variance of
the expectation when applying the LCU to a set of parametrised circuits, taking
into account the postselection probability. These results extend to incoherent
superpositions. We support our conclusions with numerical results on linear
combinations of fermionic Gaussian unitaries (matchgate circuits). Our work
shows that sums of trainable parametrised circuits are still trainable, and
thus provides a method to construct new families of more expressive trainable
circuits. We argue that there is a scope for a quantum speed-up when evaluating
these trainable circuits on a quantum device.

Abstract: We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.

Abstract: Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (KANs), built upon the Kolmogorov Arnold
representation theorem (KAR), have demonstrated promising capabilities in
expressing complex functions with fewer neurons. This is achieved by
implementing learnable parameters on the edges instead of on the nodes, unlike
traditional networks such as Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). However, KANs
potential in quantum machine learning has not yet been well explored. In this
work, we present an implementation of these KAN architectures in both hybrid
and fully quantum forms using a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM). We adapt
the KAN transfer using pre-trained residual functions, thereby exploiting the
representational power of parametrized quantum circuits. In the hybrid model we
combine classical KAN components with quantum subroutines, while the fully
quantum version the entire architecture of the residual function is translated
to a quantum model. We demonstrate the feasibility, interpretability and
performance of the proposed Quantum KAN (QuKAN) architecture.

Abstract: Computational fluid dynamics lies at the heart of many issues in science and
engineering, but solving the associated partial differential equations remains
computationally demanding. With the rise of quantum computing, new approaches
have emerged to address these challenges. In this work, we investigate the
potential of quantum algorithms for solving the shallow water equations, which
are, for example, used to model tsunami dynamics. By extending a linearization
scheme previously developed in [Phys. Rev. Research 7, 013036 (2025)] for the
Navier-Stokes equations, we create a mapping from the nonlinear shallow water
equation to a linear system of equations, which, in principle, can be solved
exponentially faster on a quantum device than on a classical computer. To
validate our approach, we compare its results to an analytical solution and
benchmark its dependence on key parameters. Additionally, we implement a
quantum linear system solver based on quantum singular value transformation and
study its performance in connection to our mapping. Our results demonstrate the
potential of applying quantum algorithms to fluid dynamics problems and
highlight necessary considerations for future developments.

Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of open quantum systems remains a
significant challenge, particularly for Non-Markovian dynamics. We demonstrate
the profound utility of expressing the environmental correlation function as a
sum of damped sinusoidals within master equations. While not strictly required,
this decomposition offers substantial benefits, crucially reducing the cost of
Lamb-shift and decay rates calculations without sacrificing accuracy.
Furthermore, this approach enables straightforward calculation of Lamb-shift
corrections, bypassing the need for complex principal value integration. We
show that these Lamb-shift effects are demonstrably non-negligible in heat
transport scenarios, and are needed for an accurate description. Unlike in the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan(GKLS) master equation, the non-commuting
nature of the Lamb-shift with the Hamiltonian in non-Markovian descriptions,
coupled with GKLS's inaccuracies at early times, brings the necessity of
Non-Markovian descriptions for finite-time thermodynamics. In the weak coupling
regime, our Master Equation formulations with exponential decomposition achieve
accuracy comparable to numerically exact methods. This methodology
significantly simplifies and accelerates the simulation of non-Markovian
dynamics in open quantum systems, offering a more reliable and computationally
tractable alternative akin to a Global Master Equation.

Abstract: Single-photon purity is one of the most important key metrics of many quantum
states of light. For applications in photonic quantum technologies, e.g.
quantum communication and linear optical quantum computing, a minimization of
the multi-photon error rate is required because of its error-introducing
nature. Ultimately, the purity of state-of-the-art single-photon sources was
found to be limited by spontaneous emission and subsequent reexcitation during
the interaction with the driving field. Here, we demonstrate that even this
fundamental limit to the single-photon purity can be overcome due to the
distinct spectro-temporal properties of the individual photons forming
multi-photon errors. For driving pulses shorter than the emitter lifetime, we
find that photons emitted during the pulse exhibit a significantly broader
spectral shape than the emitter's natural linewidth. Thus, we can selectively
filter out the majority of this instantaneously emitted photon by employing
narrowband spectral filters which reduces the measured degree of second-order
coherence at zero time delay by almost one order of magnitude. This enables a
significant suppression of the multi-photon error rate without detrimental
effects on the desired single-photon emission.

Abstract: Spin-squeezed states are a prototypical example of metrologically useful
quantum states where structured entanglement allows for enhanced sensing with
respect to the one possible using classically correlated particles. Relevant
aspects are both the efficient preparation of spin-squeezed states and the
scalability of estimation precision with the number $N$ of probes. Recently, in
the context of the generation of spin-squeezed states via coupling of
three-level atoms to an optical cavity, it was shown that increasing the
atom-cavity coupling can be detrimental to spin-squeezing generation, an effect
that is not appreciated in the standard second-order cavity removal
approximation. We describe adiabatic elimination techniques to derive an
effective Lindblad master equation up to third order for the atomic degrees of
freedom. We then show through numerical simulations that the spin-squeezing
scalability loss is correctly reproduced by the reduced open system dynamics,
pinpointing the relevant role of higher order contributions.

Abstract: As quantum computing progresses, variational quantum eigensolvers (VQE) for
ground-state preparation have become an attractive option in leveraging current
quantum hardware. However, a major challenge in implementing VQE is
understanding whether a given quantum system can even reach the target ground
state. In this work, we study reachability conditions for VQE by analyzing
their inherent symmetries. We consider a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator with
global controls and evaluate its ability to reach ground states for Ising and
Heisenberg target Hamiltonians. Symmetry-based conclusions for a smaller number
of qubits are corroborated by VQE simulations, demonstrating the reliability of
our approach in predicting whether a given quantum architecture could
successfully reach the ground state. Our framework also suggests approaches to
overcome symmetry restrictions by adding additional quantum resources or
choosing different initial states, offering practical guidance for implementing
VQE in quantum simulation architectures. Finally, we illustrate connections to
adiabatic state preparation.

Abstract: We demonstrate an end-to-end workflow to model chemical reaction barriers
with the quantum-classical auxiliary field quantum Monte Carlo (QC-AFQMC)
algorithm with quantum tomography using matchgate shadows. The workflow
operates within an accelerated quantum supercomputing environment with the IonQ
Forte quantum computer and NVIDIA GPUs on Amazon Web Services. We present
several algorithmic innovations and an efficient GPU-accelerated execution,
which achieves a several orders of magnitude speedup over the state-of-the-art
implementation of QC-AFQMC. We apply the algorithm to simulate the oxidative
addition step of the nickel-catalyzed Suzuki-Miyaura reaction using 24 qubits
of IonQ Forte with 16 qubits used to represent the trial state, plus 8
additional ancilla qubits for error mitigation, resulting in the largest
QC-AFQMC with matchgate shadow experiments ever performed on quantum hardware.
We achieve a $9\times$ speedup in collecting matchgate circuit measurements,
and our distributed-parallel post-processing implementation attains a
$656\times$ time-to-solution improvement over the prior state-of-the-art.
Chemical reaction barriers for the model reaction evaluated with active-space
QC-AFQMC are within the uncertainty interval of $\pm4$ kcal/mol from the
reference CCSD(T) result when matchgates are sampled on the ideal simulator and
within 10 kcal/mol from reference when measured on QPU. This work marks a step
towards practical quantum chemistry simulations on quantum devices while
identifying several opportunities for further development.

Abstract: Spectroscopy underpins modern scientific discovery across diverse
disciplines. While experimental spectroscopy probes material properties through
scattering or radiation measurements, computational spectroscopy combines
theoretical models with experimental data to predict spectral properties,
essential for advancements in physics, chemistry, and materials science.
However, quantum systems present unique challenges for computational
spectroscopy due to their inherent complexity, and current quantum algorithms
remain largely limited to static and closed quantum systems. Here, we present
and demonstrate a universal quantum computational spectroscopy framework that
lifts these limitations. Through leveraging coherently controlled quantum
dynamics, our method efficiently reconstructs the spectral information for both
closed and open systems, furtherly for time-dependent driven systems. We
experimentally validate this approach using a programmable silicon-photonic
quantum processing chip, capable of high-fidelity time-evolution simulations.
The versatility of our framework is demonstrated through spectroscopic
computations for diverse quantum systems -- including spin systems,
non-Hermitian systems, and quantum Floquet systems -- revealing novel phenomena
such as parity-time symmetry breaking and topological holonomy that are
inaccessible to conventional spectroscopy or quantum eigenstate algorithms.
{Furthermore, systematic benchmarking of UQCS against existing quantum
algorithms is numerically performed to demonstrate its unprecedented
capabilities and superior performance. This work establishes a noise-robust and
transformative paradigm for quantum spectral analysis.

Abstract: Sharing entangled pairs between non-signaling parties via entanglement
swapping constitutes a striking demonstration of the nonlocality of quantum
mechanics and a crucial building block for future quantum technologies. In this
work, we generalize pair-swapping methods by introducing a many-body
entanglement swapping protocol, which allows two non-signaling parties to share
general many-body states along an arbitrary partitioning. The shared many-body
state retains exactly the same Schmidt vectors as the target state and exhibits
typically high fidelity, which approaches unity as the variance of the Schmidt
coefficients vanishes. The cost of many-body swapping - arising from
postselection in a third-party measurement - is determined by the 3rd R\'enyi
entanglement entropy of the partitioning. We provide a proof of concept of the
protocol on real quantum hardware and discuss how it enables new
functionalities, such as flexible sharing of complex multi-qubit states and
fault-tolerant entanglement swapping.

Abstract: The Lindblad master equation is a foundational tool for modeling the dynamics
of open quantum systems. As its use has extended far beyond its original
domain, the boundaries of its validity have grown opaque. In particular, the
rise of new research areas including open quantum many-body systems,
non-equilibrium condensed matter, and the possibility to test its limits in
driven-open quantum simulators, call for a critical revision of its regimes of
applicability. In this pedagogical review, we re-examine the folklore
surrounding its three standard approximations (Born, Markov, and Rotating Wave
Approximation), as we build our narrative by employing a series of examples and
case studies accessible to any reader with a solid background on the
fundamentals of quantum mechanics. As a synthesis of our work, we offer a
checklist that contrasts common lore with refined expectations, offering a
practical guideline for assessing the breakdown of the Lindblad framework in
the problem at hand.
