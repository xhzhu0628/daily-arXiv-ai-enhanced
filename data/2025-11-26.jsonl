Moreover, these bounds are shown to be nearly tight. Both bounds sharpen the previously known requirement of $k \\ge \\lceil \\log_2 |G| + \\log_2(1/ε) \\rceil + 2$. Our results provide a foundational tool for analyzing probabilistic algorithms, enabling a better estimation of the iteration count for the finite Abelian hidden subgroup problem (AHSP) standard quantum algorithm and a reduction in the circuit repetitions required by Regev's factoring algorithm."}

Though the photoluminescence readout and the associated dynamics of the NV defect has been extensively studied experimentally and theoretically, so far, there has been no precise model for photocurrent readout, including these effects. In our description, we use a multilevel-level system including mS=0, mS=+-1 ground and excited states, singlet state and the NV0 neutral state. Also, the presence of substitutional nitrogen (NS), which for example determines the spin coherence via the paramagnetic spin bath, is discussed together with presence of acceptor defects. We model the time-dependent occupation of all electronic sublevels and also consider the electronic charge transport from the Boltzmann transport equation, leading to information about the charge state transitions and recombination dynamics. ODMR and PDMR response as well as their quantum efficiencies, are calculated.

From this perspective, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) in the steady state arises from the anyon condensation on the boundary of a topological order in one higher dimension. The conditional mutual information (CMI) associated with SWSSB is then inherited from the bulk topological entanglement entropy. We make this duality explicit using isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) by identifying the channel's time evolution with the transfer matrix of a higher-dimensional isoTNS.

A popular transformation step in this pipeline involves the quadratization of higher-order binary optimization problems, translating them into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulations through the introduction of auxiliary variables. Conventional algorithms for the selection of auxiliary variables often aim to minimize the total number of required variables without taking the constraints of the underlying quantum computer-in particular, the connectivity of its qubits-into consideration. This quickly results in interaction graphs that are incompatible with the target device, resulting in a substantial compilation overhead even with highly optimized compilers. To address this issue, this work presents a novel approach for the selection of auxiliary variables tailored for architectures with limited connectivity. By specifically constructing an interaction graph with a regular structure and a limited maximal degree of vertices, we find a way to construct QAOA circuits that can be mapped efficiently to a variety of architectures. We show that, compared to circuits constructed from a QUBO formulation using conventional auxiliary selection methods, the proposed approach reduces the circuit depth by almost 40%.

Standard equilibrium approaches, limited by the Quantum Fisher Information given by static energy fluctuations, lose sensitivity outside a fixed temperature window. Non-equilibrium strategies have therefore been recently proposed to overcome these limits, but their advantages are typically model-dependent or tailored for a specific purpose. This Letter establishes a general, model-independent result showing that any temperature-dependent unitary driving applied to a thermalized probe enhances its quantum Fisher information with respect to its equilibrium value. Such information gain is expressed analytically through a positive semi-definite kernel of information currents that quantify the flow of statistical distinguishability. Our results are benchmarked on a driven spin-$1/2$ thermometer, furthermore showing that resonant modulations remarkably restore the quadratic-in-time scaling of the Fisher information and allow to shift the sensitivity peak across arbitrary temperature ranges.

The method is most beneficial for dynamics that naturally separate into unitary and dissipative components, with broad applications across science and engineering. These systems frequently admit compact spectral representations of the split operators, which we demonstrate by deriving efficient quantum circuits for simulating the damped-wave equation with up to sixth-order accuracy in time.

Here we develop a comprehensive analysis of two coupled harmonic oscillators driven by independent squeezed baths, focusing on the emergence of coherence-driven entropy flow and the structure of exceptional points (EPs) in the corresponding Lindblad dynamics. Working entirely within the Gaussian formalism, we derive closed-form evolution equations for the covariance matrix and show that squeezing induces entropy generation only at *second order* in the anomalous correlations, a nonlinear mechanism absent in thermal environments. This entropy flow is accompanied by a rich non-Hermitian structure: by scanning the squeezing parameters we uncover a characteristic \"exceptional-point fan\" in the (M1, M2) plane, which separates a narrow PT-unbroken region of oscillatory dynamics from broad PT-broken sectors in which one normal mode becomes purely overdamped. This geometric organization of EPs reveals that PT symmetry survives only when the two reservoirs squeeze opposite quadratures, and is generically broken for in-phase squeezing. Our analysis establishes squeezed reservoirs as a natural setting where information-bearing noise drives irreversible behavior through coherent pathways, and lays the groundwork for experimentally accessible probes of entropy flow and critical mode behavior in more complex open systems."}

The same physical mechanisms that reduce quantum coherence, such as dephasing and amplitude damping, are repurposed as programmable resources for noise suppression. Practical demonstrations implemented with Qiskit illustrate how circuits and channels emulate coefficientwise attenuation, and all examples are provided as Jupyter notebooks in the companion GitHub repository. Encoding schemes for amplitude, phase, and hybrid representations are examined in relation to transform coherence and measurement feasibility, and realizations suited to current noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices are discussed.

However, the spacetime overhead required for fault-tolerant quantum computating remains prohibitively large. A critical challenge arises in many quantum algorithms with Clifford + $\\varphi$ compiling, where logical rotation gates $R_{Z_L}(\\varphi)$ serve as essential components. The Eastin-Knill theorem prevents their transversal implementation in quantum error correction codes and necessitating resource-intensive workarounds through T-gate compilation combined with magic state distillation and injection. In this work, we consider error-structure-tailored fault tolerance, where fault-tolerance conditions are analyzed by combining perturbative analysis of realistic dissipative noise processes with the structural properties of stabilizer codes. Based on this framework, we design 1-fault-tolerant continuous-angle rotation gates in stabilizer codes, implemented via dispersive-coupling Hamiltonians. Our approach could circumvent the need for T-gate compilation and distillation, offering a hardware-efficient solution that maintains simplicity, minimizes physical footprint, and requires only nearest-neighbor interactions. Integrating with recent small-angle-state preparation techniques, we can suppress the gate error to $91|\\varphi| p^2$ for small rotation angle (where p denotes the physical error rate). For current achievable hardware parameters ($p=10^{-3}$), this enables reliable execution of over $10^7$ small-angle rotations when $|\\varphi|\\approx 10^{-3}$, meeting the requirements of many near-term quantum applications.

We show that imposing phase-covariance, flip covariance, permutation invariance, and classical consistency fully determines the structure of the broadcasting map. Within this family, we identify the unique map that minimizes the simulation cost, and we prove that both the simulation cost and the distance to the closest CPTP map are strictly smaller than in the unitary covariant setting. We also demonstrate that the closest physical map is the optimal phase-covariant cloning channel, mirroring the relation between unitary covariant broadcasting and universal cloning.

While an adiabatic transport of atomic qubits guarantees a high fidelity of the state preparation, it requires a long timescale that defies efficient quantum operations. Here, we propose an adaptable and fast bang-bang-bang (BBB) protocol, utilizing a combination of forwardand backward-moving trap potentials, to expedite the coherent state transport. This protocol approaches the quantum speed limit under a harmonic trap potential, surpassing the performance by the forward-moving-only potential protocols. We further showcase the advantage of applying squeezed coherent state evolution under a deeper potential followed by a weaker one, where a design of symmetric squeezing potential transports promotes an even shorter timescale for genuine state preparation. Our protocols outperform conventional forward-moving-only methods, providing new insights and opportunities for rapid state transport and preparation, ultimately advancing the capabilities of quantum control and quantum operations."}

Unlike classical amplifiers, SPAs can achieve or closely approach quantum-limited performance, specifically the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL) of half a photon of added noise for phase-preserving amplification. The core principle of SPAs relies on parametric amplification, where energy is transferred from a strong pump tone to a weak input signal through non-dissipative nonlinear mixing processes. This is enabled by intrinsic nonlinearities in superconducting materials, primarily kinetic inductance in thin films (e.g., NbTiN, Al) and, more significantly, the Josephson effect in Josephson junctions. These nonlinear elements facilitate frequency mixing (three-wave or four-wave mixing) and can operate in phase-preserving or phase-sensitive amplification modes, with the latter allowing for noise squeezing below the SQL. This chapter emphasizes the significant role of resonator design in determining critical SPA performance metrics such as gain, bandwidth, and noise characteristics. It details both lumped-element (LC) and distributed-element (coplanar waveguide, CPW) resonators, discussing their unique properties, suitability for different frequency ranges, and the importance of achieving high-quality factors (Q) for efficient energy storage and minimal loss. A practical design and simulation of a meandered quarterwavelength CPW resonator coupled to a feed line is presented, illustrating how precise control over geometric parameters optimizes resonant frequency, coupling strength, and quality factor for high-fidelity qubit state discrimination."}

Therefore a full quantum treatment is rarely possible analytically and can be carried out numerically for fairly small systems only. Fortunately, in order to obtain interesting physics, approximations often very well suffice. One of these approximations is given by the cumulants expansion, where expectation values of products of operators are approximated by products of expectation values of said operators, neglecting higher-order correlations. The lowest order of this approximation is widely known as the mean field approximation and used routinely throughout quantum physics. Despite its ubiquitous presence, a general criterion for applicability and convergence properties of higher order cumulants expansions remains to be found. In this paper, we discuss two problems in quantum electrodynamics and quantum information, namely the collective radiative dissipation of a dipole-dipole interacting chain of atoms and the factorization of a bi-prime by annealing in an adiabatic quantum simulator. In the first case we find smooth, convergence behavior, where the approximation performs increasingly better with higher orders, while in the latter going beyond mean field turns out useless and, even for small system sizes, we are puzzled by numerically challenging and partly non-physical solutions."}

We used the first time bin for real-time phase-fluctuation monitoring.

This structure leads to two retrodictive entropic uncertainty relations, expressed directly in terms of the prior state and the POVMs, but valid independently of the retrodictive framework and fully compatible with the conventional operational interpretation of entropic uncertainty relations.

In contrast, a direct unitary implementation of the ${T}$ gate using the cubic phase gate has been shown to have logical error floor unless the GKP codestate has a biased noise profile [1]. In this work, we propose a method for on-demand noise biasing based on a standard GKP error correction circuit. This on-demand biasing circuit can be used to bias the GKP codestate before a $T$ gate and return it to a non-biased state afterwards. With the on-demand biasing circuit, we prove that the logical error rate of the $T$ gate can be made arbitrarily small as the quality of the GKP codestates increases. We complement our proof with a numerical investigation of the cubic phase gate subject to a phenomenological noise model, showing that the ${T}$ gate can achieve average gate fidelities above $99\\%$ with 12 dB of GKP squeezing without the use of postselection. Moreover, we develop a formalism for finding optimal unitary representations of logical diagonal gates in higher levels of the Clifford hierarchy that is based on a framework of ``polynomial phase stabilizers'' whose exponents are polynomial functions of one of the quadrature operators. This formalism naturally extends to multi-qubit logical gates and even to number-phase bosonic codes, providing a powerful algebraic tool for analyzing non-Clifford gates in bosonic quantum codes.\n  [1] J.

Although widely studied in optical and quantum systems, using them for energy storage in quantum systems has been difficult because existing approaches rely on gain, precise balanced loss, or explicitly non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Here we introduce a quantum energy-storage mechanism that realizes exceptional-point physics in a fully passive, physically consistent open quantum system. Instead of amplification, we use trace-preserving reservoir engineering to create an effective complex interaction between a charging mode and a storage mode through a dissipative mediator, generating an exceptional point directly in the drift matrix of the Heisenberg-Langevin equations while preserving complete positivity. The resulting dynamics exhibit two regimes: a stable phase where the stored energy saturates, and a broken phase where energy grows exponentially under a bounded coherent drive. This rapid charging arises from dissipative interference that greatly boosts energy flow between the modes without gain media or nonlinear amplification. The mechanism is compatible with optomechanical devices, superconducting circuits, and magnonic systems, offering a practical route to fast, robust, and scalable quantum energy-storage technologies and new directions in quantum thermodynamics."}

However, we show that utility functions that take into account both the rate and quality of the entanglement generation (e.g., the secret-key rate) are often non-isotonic. This makes pathfinding difficult as classical algorithms such as Dijkstra's become unsuitable, with the state of the art for quantum networks being an exhaustive search over all possible paths. In this work we present improved algorithms. First, we present two best-first-search algorithms that use destination-aware merit functions for faster convergence. One of these provably finds the best path, while the other uses heuristics to achieve an effectively sublinear scaling of the query count in the network size while in practice always finding a close-to-optimal path. Second, we present metaheuristic algorithms (simulated annealing and a genetic algorithm) that enable tuning a tradeoff between path quality and computational overhead. While we focus on swap-ASAP quantum repeaters for concreteness, our algorithms are readily generalized to different repeater schemes and models."}
