The\nsecond type, called localized-gorge BPs, which are somewhat similar to the\nlocalized-dip BPs but contain a gorge line. The third type, called\neverywhere-flat BPs, appears when the entire landscape is uniformly flat with\nalmost vanishing gradients, making optimization significantly more difficult.\nAfter illustrating these behaviors in the Gaussian function models, we extend\nthe analysis to the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We consider two\ntypes of ans\\\"atze: the hardware-efficient ansatz and the random Pauli ansatz.\nFor both ans\\\"atze, we only observe the everywhere-flat BPs. Using our\nstatistical approach, we searched for localized-dip and localized-gorge BPs but\nfound no evidence of such features in the examples studied, suggesting that\neverywhere-flat BPs dominate in these ans\\\"atze. Our method effectively probes\nlandscape features by capturing the gradient scaling across parameter space,\nmaking it a useful tool for diagnosing BPs in variational algorithms. To\nmitigate BPs in the VQE, we employ a genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the\nrandom gates generated in the ans\\\"atze, thereby reshaping the cost function\nlandscape to enhance the optimization efficiency. A comparison with an\nunoptimized ansatz shows how the ansatz design can improve the scalability and\nreliability of variational quantum algorithms."}

Here, we relax the no-information condition by allowing the $d$ outcomes\nto be predicted according to a predefined probability distribution\n$q=(q_0,\\cdots,q_{d-1})$. The notion of mutual unbiasedness, however, is\npreserved by requiring that the extracted information is the same for any\npreparation and any measurement; regardless of which state from which basis is\nchosen to prepare the system, the outcomes of measuring the system with respect\nto the other basis generate the same probability distribution. In the light of\nthis, we define the notion of \\emph{mutually equi-biased bases} (MEBs) such\nthat within each basis the states are equi-biased with respect to the states of\nthe other basis and that the bases are mutually equi-biased with respect to\neach other. For $d=2,3$, we derive a complete set of $d+1$ MEBs. The mutual\nequi-biasedness imposes nontrivial constraints on the distribution $q$, leading\nfor $d=3$ to the restriction $1/3\\le\\mu \\le 1/2$ where\n$\\mu=\\sum_{k=0}^{2}q_k^2$. To capture the incompatibility of the measurements\nin MEBs, we derive an inequality for the probabilities of projective\nmeasurements in a qudit system, which yields an associated entropic uncertainty\ninequality. Finally, we construct a class of positive maps and their associated\nentanglement witnesses based on MEBs. While an entanglement witness constructed\nfrom MUBs is generally finer than one based on MEBs when both use the same\nnumber of bases, for certain values of the index $\\mu$, employing a larger set\nof MEBs can yield a finer witness. We illustrate this behavior using isotropic\nstates of a $3\\times 3$ system."}

This situation raises the question whether\nthe simulation results are physically meaningful. We demonstrate that, in fact,\nthe two truncation schemes correspond to two well-defined, distinct unitary\nevolutions whose generators are defined on different subsets of the\ninfinite-dimensional Fock space. This is a consequence of the fact that the\ngeneralized squeezing Hamiltonian is not self-adjoint on states with finite\nexcitations, but possesses multiple self-adjoint extensions. Furthermore, we\npresent results on the spectrum of the squeezing operators corresponding to\neven and odd truncation size that elucidate the properties of the two different\nself-adjoint extensions corresponding to the even and odd truncation scheme. To\nmake the squeezing operator applicable to a physical system, we must regularize\nit by other terms that depend on the specifics of the experimental\nimplementation.
