We show that Higher-Order Unconstrained Binary Optimization (HUBO) enables a more resource-efficient formulation. Our method systematically constructs HUBO Hamiltonians and, compared to QUBO in benchmarks on Gate Assignment (GAP), Maximum k-Colorable Subgraph (MkCS), and Integer Programming (IP) problems, exponentially reduces qubit requirements and decreases CNOT gate counts by at least 89.6% after compilation to single- and two-qubit gates for all tested instances. These results highlight HUBO as a practical alternative for current and near-term devices. To promote adoption, we release an open-source Python library that automates HUBO model construction, broadening access to resource-efficient quantum optimization."}

This collective state exhibits an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{N})$ enhancement of the transition amplitude with respect to an applied microwave field, where $N$ is the number of entangled spin qubits. We computationally realize this amplification using an ensemble of $N$ triplet spins with magnetic dipole interactions, where the largest transition amplitudes occur at geometries for which the condensation of particle-hole pairs is strongest. This effect, robust to noise, originates from the concentration of entanglement into a single collective mode, reflected in a large eigenvalue of the particle-hole reduced density matrix -- an entanglement witness of condensation analogous to off-diagonal long-range order, though realized here in a finite system. These results offer a design principle for quantum sensors that exploit condensation-inspired entanglement to boost sensitivity in spin-based platforms."}

Our approach block encodes the exact expression for the second derivative of the energy and uses quantum linear systems algorithms to deal with the reciprocal powers of the gaps that appear in the expression. We further show that if prior knowledge about the values of the second derivative is used then our algorithm can $ε$-approximate the entropy using a number of queries that scales with the condition number $κ$, the temperature $T$, error tolerance $ε$ and an analogue of the partition function $\\mathcal{Z}$, as $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{\\mathcal{Z}κ^2 }{εT}\\right)$.

Spin chains, in particular, exhibit unique {charging} properties across diverse settings.

Using Clifford quantum cellular automata and momentum-space Floquet analysis with the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we obtain exact expressions for energy injection, uncovering the influence of boundary conditions and spin-chain parity on charging performance. The kicked-Ising QB achieves maximal charging while exhibiting remarkable robustness against disorder. We further propose an intensified protocol within a fixed time window that enables faster and more efficient energy injection, while non-uniform kick schedules enhance experimental flexibility. Spin correlators analysis further shows that low-frequency driving boosts energy injection, highlighting a clear connection between charging, scrambling, and kick-induced delocalization. Our theoretical framework are supported by tensor-network simulations and finally verified on IBM quantum hardware. Accounting for platform-specific constraints, we demonstrate that the kicked-Ising QB offers a scalable, disorder-resilient protocol and testbed to assess quantum platforms."}

While the non-Bloch polarization $P_β$ defined on the generalized Brillouin zone restores momentum-space topology, a direct, robust real-space bulk probe has remained elusive. We resolve this by establishing a universal correspondence between $P_β$ and the entanglement polarization $χ$ of the biorthogonal ground state. Introducing a quasi-reciprocal Hamiltonian $\\tilde{H}$ that removes the NHSE while preserving bulk topology, we rigorously prove the fundamental identity $P_β \\equiv χ(\\tilde{H})\\pmod 1$ in the thermodynamic limit under the quasi-locality assumption. Crucially, we demonstrate that this equivalence transcends the locality constraints that limit traditional topological invariants. While the conventional Resta polarization fails when $\\tilde{H}$ becomes non-local due to the divergence of position variance, we reveal that $χ(\\tilde{H})$ remains robustly quantized, protected by the Fredholm index of Toeplitz operators. Our work thus identifies entanglement as the unique real-space diagnostic capable of capturing non-Bloch topology beyond the breakdown of locality, successfully restoring the BBC across diverse non-Hermitian systems such as line-gap, point-gap, and gapless phases, thereby unifying the geometric and entanglement paradigms in non-Hermitian physics."}

This protocol is efficient for Clifford+T circuits with logarithmically many T-gates, where the limiting factor in the efficiency of the protocol is the difficulty, on input a quantum circuit $C$, of the classical task of producing a description of the unitary obtained by conjugating a Pauli $P$ (corresponding to a Bell-measurement outcome) by $C$, where this description only depends on the input-output functionality of $CPC^{\\dagger}$. The task above, in turn, is at least as hard as the problem of determining whether two $n$-qubit quantum circuits are perfectly equivalent up to global phase. In 2009, Tanaka defined the corresponding decision problem Exact Non-Identity Check (ENIC) and showed that ENIC is NQP-complete in general. Motivated by this, we consider in this work what happens when we pass from low T-count to low T-depth. In particular, we show that, for Clifford+T circuits of T-depth $O(\\log(n))$, deciding ENIC is NP-hard.

We find that constraints based solely on the mean energy of the Hamiltonian are insufficient to bound the entanglement generation rate, whereas imposing a variance constraint ensures a finite and well-defined maximum. We fully characterize the Hamiltonians that achieve this optimal rate, establishing a direct relation between their imaginary components in the Schmidt basis and the structure of the optimal initial states. For systems without ancillas, we obtain a closed-form expression for the maximal rate in terms of the surprisal variance of the Schmidt coefficients and identify the family of optimal states and Hamiltonians. We further extend our analysis to scenarios where Alice and Bob may employ local ancillary systems: using a matrix-analytic framework and a refined description of the Hamiltonians allowed by the physical constraints, we derive an explicit optimization formula and characterize the attainable enhancement in entanglement generation."}

This encryption procedure has been defined based on a public-key cryptosystem. Initially, we present a quantum analogue of the classical anamorphic encryption definition that is based on public-key encryption.

They are defined as the maximum classical relative entropy or Rényi relative entropy realizable by performing a measurement on $ρ$ and $σ$, and they have interpretations in terms of asymptotic quantum hypothesis testing. Crucially, they can be rewritten in terms of variational formulas involving the optimization of a concave or convex objective function over the set of positive definite operators. In this paper, we establish foundational properties of these objective functions by analyzing their matrix gradients and Hessian superoperators; namely, we prove that these objective functions are $β$-smooth and $γ$-strongly convex / concave, where $β$ and $γ$ depend on the max-relative entropies of $ρ$ and $σ$. A practical consequence of these properties is that we can conduct Nesterov accelerated projected gradient descent / ascent, a well known classical optimization technique, to calculate the measured relative entropy and measured Rényi relative entropy to arbitrary precision.

Here we introduce a hierarchy of cost-effective approximate TD-dCC ansatzes derived from truncated Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff (BCH) expansions, which preserve a single-similarity-transformation structure while retaining the essential correlation diagrams responsible for satellite formation. We further develop a detailed component analysis that isolates hole-mediated excitation pathways, which are correlated processes arising from the coupling between ground-state and ionized-state amplitudes. We use it to interpret quasiparticle and satellite features across the hierarchy. Applications to the single-impurity Anderson model and molecular systems (H2O and CH4) demonstrate that the approximate TD-dCC methods closely and efficiently reproduce exact many-body spectral features and quasiparticle weights.

Here we overcome this limitation using a minimal step: a nonlinear phase-insensitive absorption process added to the linear one. The coherent addition of such individually passive processes allows coherence to emerge and increase in phase space without an external drive and with minimal interaction requirements. The coherence of quantum non-Gaussian states emerges because the linear and nonlinear absorption processes are not mutually passive. In the simplest case rotationally symmetric Wigner functions of the oscillator Fock states convert their many negative regions to an extremely complex asymmetric structure in sharp contrast to the rotational symmetry of those obtained by the individual interactions.

These capabilities open avenues to address scalability challenges in neutral-atom quantum computers and simulators, enabling fast optical readout, efficient and subwavelength non-diffracting interaction zones, and genuine compatibility with integrated solid-state photon sources, detectors, and stop-band modulators. Beyond controllable quantum matter, the platform also enables in-situ imaging of evanescent fields of light and nanoscale structures, including prospects for three-dimensional scanning microscopy with non-invasive single-atom probes for quantum sensing applications."}

Quantum mutual information (QMI), a fundamental nonlocal measure, plays a key role in quantifying entanglement and has become increasingly important in studying nonequilibrium quantum many-body phenomena, such as many-body localization and thermalization. However, experimental measurement of QMI remains extremely difficult, particularly for nonequilibrium states, which are more complex than ground states. In this Letter, we employ a multilayer perceptron (MLP) to establish a universal mapping between the QMI and local correlations only up to second order for nonequilibrium states generated by quenches in a one-dimensional disordered XXZ model. Our approach provides a practical method for experimentally extracting QMI, readily applicable in platforms such as superconducting qubits.

The Coulomb interaction between charged particles is the simplest example. We show that after eliminating the harmonic part of the Coulomb force by an auxiliary linear force, the remaining reciprocal nonlinear part results in a directly observable non-reciprocal nonlinear effect: increase of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the coherent displacement of one particle, driven by the position noise, or uncertainty in quantum regime, in another particle. This essential evidence of nonlinear forces is present across large ranges of trap frequency and mass scales, as well as visible in both stochastic and quantum regimes."}

The charging process relies on coherent energy exchange, where the atoms couple to the cavity, which in turn, it interacts with the magnon mode via a beam-splitter mechanism. By deriving the system Hamiltonian under the rotating-wave approximation and employing a Lindblad master equation to rigorously model dissipation, we analyze the complete dynamical evolution of the battery. Our study demonstrates that strong, resonant light-matter interactions are crucial for enhancing the key performance metrics: charging efficiency, stored energy, and ergotropy (extractable work). We systematically investigate the deleterious effects of detuning and decoherence, and critically, we uncover a non-trivial interplay between the system's coupling strengths. This reveals optimal operating regimes where constructive interference maximizes performance, while excessive coupling in specific channels can degrade it.

In this work, we investigate the exceptional structure for a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit, realized with a Kerr nonlinear resonator. We find that the dissipation leads to a bidirectional jump between the two basis states of the cat qubit, which is in distinct contrast with the unidirectional jump associated with normal two-level systems. The competition between this jump and a single-photon drive gives arise to the emergence of third-order Liouvillian exceptional points (LEP3s), each corresponds to a crossing point of two lines of LEP2s.

In this article, we extend fractional calculus to explore a particle in a periodic potential, where the Schrödinger equation is generalized to its fractional form. This framework allows us to study how the Lévy index $q$ governs the formation and inversion of energy bands, offering a pathway to engineer new physical behaviors and device functionalities by tuning $q$ in periodic quantum systems. We solve the fractional Schrödinger equation for periodic rectangular potentials of varying height $V_0$, barrier thickness $L$, and well width $W$ using an imaginary-time evolution algorithm, and supplement the discrete energy dispersion through Gaussian process regression. Our analysis reveals a qualitative shift in the band structure at $q=2$, separating into regimes for $q>2$ and $q<2$. For $q > 2$, energy bands undergo an inverting transformation as symmetric minima emerge within the first Brillouin zone, shifting from $k=0$ toward $k=\\pm π/a$ with increasing $q$. These degenerate minima define a Bloch-momentum qubit, suggesting an analog to valley degrees of freedom used in valleytronics. The response of the ground band scales with fractional order as $V_0^{-0.28\\pm0.05}L^{-0.34\\pm0.08}W^{-0.49\\pm0.06}$, indicating tunable sensitivity to geometry. For $q < 2$, the effective mass near $k = 0$ decreases exponentially with $q$, yielding a universal effective mass of $0.15\\pm0.01$ as $q \\to 1$, demonstrating that the Lévy index serves as a tunable degree of freedom capable of driving band inversion, modulating the band gap, and reshaping carrier dynamics."}

This demonstrates that in general there is no tension between failures of local tomography and classical explainability (i.e., generalised noncontextuality). In fact, bilocal classical theory is in many ways more simply understood via the underlying ontological model than it is within its original formulation (much as how odd-dimensional stabiliser subtheories can be more simply understood via Spekkens' toy theory). Furthermore, this result naturally leads to the question, does every locally-classical theory admit of an ontological model? By constructing a concrete counterexample, we show that this is not the case. Our findings demonstrate that there is no straightforward relationship between theories being locally-classical, and them being classically-explainable.

Quantum neural estimators (QNEs), which utilize a hybrid classical-quantum architecture, have recently emerged as an appealing computational framework for estimating these measures. Such estimators combine classical neural networks with parametrized quantum circuits, and their deployment typically entails tedious tuning of hyperparameters controlling the sample size, network architecture, and circuit topology. This work initiates the study of formal guarantees for QNEs of measured (Rényi) relative entropies in the form of non-asymptotic error risk bounds. We further establish exponential tail bounds showing that the error is sub-Gaussian, and thus sharply concentrates about the ground truth value. For an appropriate sub-class of density operator pairs on a space of dimension $d$ with bounded Thompson metric, our theory establishes a copy complexity of $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|d/ε^2)$ for QNE with a quantum circuit parameter set $Θ(\\mathcal{U})$, which has minimax optimal dependence on the accuracy $ε$. Additionally, if the density operator pairs are permutation invariant, we improve the dimension dependence above to $O(|Θ(\\mathcal{U})|\\mathrm{polylog}(d)/ε^2)$.

Recently, Vasiliev has shown that the phase form of shallow quantum hashing can be implemented by a circuit of depth 2. In this paper, we establish a connection between shallow quantum hashing and single-qubit quantum hashing for the amplitude form. For a shallow circuit, we propose a circuit of depth 1 that achieves the same collision resistance."}

We provide a tight lower bound on the minimum efficiency required to observe a desired Bell-CHSH violation using the Navascués-Pironio-Acín (NPA) hierarchy, confirming tightness up to four decimal places with numerical optimization over explicit quantum realizations. We then introduce the effect of dark counts and demonstrate how to quantify the minimum required efficiency to observe a desired CHSH violation with an increasing dark count error. Finally, to obtain an analytical closed-form expression of the minimum efficiency, we consider the set of no-signaling behaviors that satisfy the Tsirelson bound, which are easier to characterize than the quantum set. Using such behaviors, we find a simple closed-form expression for a lower bound on the minimum efficiency which is monotonically increasing with the CHSH violation, though the analytically obtained lower bounds are meaningfully below the numerically tight lower bound."}

In this work, we employ a comprehensive toolbox of state-of-the-art numerical approaches to classically simulate the dynamics of the two-dimensional transverse field Ising model. Our methods include three different tensor network techniques -- matrix product states, tree-tensor networks, and two-dimensional tensor-networks under the belief propagation approximation -- as well as time-dependent variational Monte Carlo with Neural Quantum States. We focus on two paradigmatic dynamical protocols: (i) quantum annealing through a critical point and (ii) post-quench dynamics. Our extensive results show the quantitative predictions of various state-of-the-art numerical methods providing a benchmark for future numerical investigations and experimental studies with the aim to push the limitations on classical and QPUs. In particular, our work connects classical simulability to different regimes associated with quantum dynamics in Rydberg arrays - namely, quasi-adiabatic dynamics, the Kibble-Zurek mechanism, and quantum quenches."}

Specifically, we show that the response to perturbations coupled to the particle number within a finite region exhibits the same size scaling as the entanglement entropy of that region. We explicitly verify this scaling in free-fermion systems that display area-law, volume-law, and critical forms of entanglement. The resulting entanglement-governed scaling of response functions leads to unexpected physical consequences. For instance, contrary to conventional expectations, the energy absorption rate and particle-number fluctuations in gapped systems scale with the boundary of the perturbed region rather than with its volume. Our work thus establishes a direct link between linear-response properties and many-body entanglement."}
