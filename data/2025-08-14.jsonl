However, achieving\noptomechanical cooling in the unresolved-sideband regime ($\\omega_b < \\kappa$)\nremains challenging. In this Letter, we propose an efficient cooling strategy\nbased on a hybrid optomechanical system incorporating a yttrium iron garnet\n(YIG) sphere embedded in an optomechanical cavity. Under strong cavity driving,\nthe Kerr nonlinearity of the magnons hosted in the YIG sphere gives rise to a\ntwo-magnon process. Adiabatic elimination of the magnons yields an effective\ntwo-photon process in the cavity, which destructively interferes with all\ndissipative channels, surpassing the quantum backaction limit and enabling\n\\textit{complete suppression} of heating under optimal conditions, even in the\ndeeply unresolved sideband regime (DUSR: $\\omega_b \\ll \\kappa$). Moreover,\ninjecting squeezed vacuum noise into the cavity not only preserves these\nadvantages but also delivers additional enhancements, including higher net\ncooling rates, reduced optomechanical coupling requirements, and improved noise\nrobustness. Comparative analysis shows that our approach outperforms existing\nschemes without Kerr magnons, underscoring the potential of integrating\nnonlinear magnonics with optomechanics for quantum control of macroscopic\nmechanical systems."}

An analogous behavior occurs in\ncertain quantum systems where quantum states can recur after sufficiently long\nunitary evolution, a phenomenon known as quantum recurrence. Periodically\ndriven (i.e. Floquet) quantum systems in particular exhibit complex dynamics\neven in small dimensions, motivating the study of how interactions and\nHamiltonian structure affect recurrence behavior. While most existing studies\ntreat recurrence in an approximate, distance-based sense, here we address the\nproblem of exact, state-independent recurrences in a broad class of\nfinite-dimensional Floquet systems, spanning both integrable and non-integrable\nmodels. Leveraging techniques from algebraic field theory, we construct an\narithmetic framework that identifies all possible recurrence times by analyzing\nthe cyclotomic structure of the Floquet unitary's spectrum. This\ncomputationally efficient approach yields both positive results, enumerating\nall candidate recurrence times and definitive negative results, rigorously\nruling out exact recurrences for given Hamiltonian parameters. We further prove\nthat rational Hamiltonian parameters do not, in general, guarantee exact\nrecurrence, revealing a subtle interplay between system parameters and\nlong-time dynamics.

These thresholds\nare important quantities as they mark the noise level up to which faithful\nquantum communication is theoretically possible. Our method exploits the fact\nthat independent and identically distributed quantum channels preserve any\npermutation symmetry present at the input. The resulting symmetric output\nstates can be described succinctly using the representation theory of the\nsymmetric and general linear groups, which we use to derive an efficient\nalgorithm for computing the channel coherent information of a\npermutation-invariant code. Our approach allows us to evaluate coherent\ninformation values for a large number of channel copies, e.g., at least 100\nchannel copies for qubit channels. We apply this method to various physically\nrelevant channel models, including general Pauli channels, the dephrasure\nchannel, the generalized amplitude damping channel, and the damping-dephasing\nchannel. For each channel family we obtain improved lower bounds on their\nquantum capacities. For example, for the 2-Pauli and BB84 channel families we\nsignificantly improve the best known quantum capacity thresholds derived in\n[Fern, Whaley 2008].
