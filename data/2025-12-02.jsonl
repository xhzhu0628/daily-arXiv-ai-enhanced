Here, we introduce a general framework for constructing Bell inequalities tailored to the $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code for odd prime local dimensions. Selecting a suitable subset of stabilizer operators and mapping them to generalized measurement observables, we compute multipartite Bell expressions whose quantum maxima admit a sum-of-squares decomposition. We show that these inequalities are maximally violated by all states in the ground-state manifold of the $\\mathbb{Z}_d$ toric code, and determine their classical (local) bounds through a combination of combinatorial tiling arguments and explicit optimization. As a concrete application, we analyze the case of $d=3$ and demonstrate that the maximal violation self-tests the full qutrit toric-code subspace, up to local isometries and complex conjugation. This constitutes, to our knowledge, the first-ever example of self-testing a qutrit subspace. Extending these constructions, we further present schemes to enhance the ratio of classical--quantum bounds and thus improve robustness to experimental imperfections. Our results establish a pathway toward device-independent certification of highly entangled topological quantum matter and provide new tools for validating qudit states in error-correcting codes and quantum simulation platforms."}

An $x$-dependent gauge transformation maps this to an equivalent description with explicit many-body potentials, illustrated by a temporal coupled-oscillator model that exhibits synchronization. Adopting a complementary spatial viewpoint with a static potential $U_{\\!tot}(\\mathbf x)$, we show that the evolution is driven by the collective force $\\sum_j\\partial_{x_j}U_{\\!tot}$; for any translation-invariant interaction (such as a regularized Coulomb potential), these internal forces cancel, rendering the collective dynamics free and highlighting Carrollian ultralocality. We also construct a coordinate duality mapping separable Schrödinger Hamiltonians to CS generators via Schwarzian derivatives. Exchange symmetry is formulated in the time domain, yielding temporal bunching for bosons and antibunching for fermions via the second-order coherence function $g^{(2)}(t,t')$. In second quantization, the contact limit yields a temporal derivative cubic--quintic nonlinear Schrödinger equation with a theoretically fixed nonlinearity coefficient $β=-3/16$.

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods."}

Numerical calculations indicate that the magnitudes of the coupling constants can be comparable to those in conventional circuits.

This rate has been conjectured by Maldecena et al. to obey a universal, temperature dependent bound. Recent studies have shown that instantons, delocalised structures that dominate tunnelling statistics over barriers, reduce the growth rate of OTOCs. For the case of the symmetric double well, this reduction ensures the bound is maintained for OTOCs generated using ring polymer molecular dynamics (RPMD), a method with approximate dynamics but exact quantum statistics. In this report we set out to further understand the role of the instanton in the enforcement of the Maldacena bound and test whether RPMD is sufficient to satisfy the bound. We also investigate the impact of coherence on the flattening of of OTOCs by contrasting bounded with scattering systems. For the scattering system we observe a significantly smaller OTOC growth rate than that of the analogous bounded system, and a flattening in growth rate as time progresses. We attribute the first effect to influence of the Boltzmann operator, and the second to interference caused by anharmonicity of the potential. In our studies of RPMD, we find counterexamples showing that it is not sufficient to satisfy the bound. We develop a theory for OTOCs using (analytically-continued) Matsubara dynamics, revealing significantly different dynamical behaviour around the instanton compared to the predictions of RPMD. The instanton is found to be stationary in all coordinates but its collective angle $Φ_0$, and fluctuations about it no longer resemble that of classical dynamics on a first order saddle as in RPMD."}

Prior studies have employed Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states as ancillary qumodes to suppress small Gaussian displacement errors, but when the displacement magnitude becomes large, lattice-crossing events arise beyond the correctable range of the GKP state. To address this issue, we concatenate a Gaussian-noise-suppression circuit with an outer analog Steane code that corrects such occasional lattice-crossing events as well as other abrupt displacement errors. Unlike conventional concatenation, which primarily aims to reduce logical error rates, the Steane-GKP duality in encoding provides complementary protection against both large and small displacement errors, enabling CV error correction within the continuous encoding space and contrasting with earlier approaches that concatenate GKP states with repetition codes for discrete qubit or qudit encodings. Analytical results show that, under infinite squeezing, the concatenated code suppresses the variance of Gaussian displacement errors across all qumodes by up to 50 percent while enabling unbiased correction of lattice-crossing events, with a success probability determined by the ratio between the residual Gaussian error standard deviation and the lattice-crossing magnitude. Even with finite squeezing, the proposed architecture continues to provide Gaussian-error suppression together with lattice-crossing correction, and the presence of the outer analog Steane code relaxes the squeezing requirement of the inner GKP states, indicating near-term experimental feasibility. This work establishes a viable route toward fault-tolerant continuous-variable quantum computation and provides new insight into the design of concatenated CV error-correcting architectures."}

In this paper, we give the properties of local distinguishability of five OPSs on bipartite and tripartite quantum systems. Firstly, to characterize the structure of a set of bipartite OPSs, we propose the concept of the vector of orthogonal relations for a set of bipartite OPSs. Secondly, we classify the structures of five bipartite OPSs into six categories by this concept and prove that five of these six categories can be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). Thirdly we show that the local distinguishability of each case of the sixth category singly. On the other hand, we first divide the structures of five tripartite OPSs into eight categories by the vectors of orthogonal relations of five tripartite OPSs.

In this work, we demonstrate the use of multiple-quantum solid-state NMR for quantum sensing by creating, manipulating, and detecting large clusters of correlated nuclear spins. We show that such clusters can sensitively detect pulse-width jitters in radio-frequency control fields at the level of tens of nanoseconds. By analyzing the response of high-order quantum coherences to these control-field jitters, we investigate the critical interplay between the enhanced sensitivity offered by large coherence orders, their relative distributions, and their varying susceptibility to decoherence. We further demonstrate that, even within a non-uniform distribution of coherence orders, there exists an optimal maximum coherence order that maximizes sensing efficiency. To support our interpretation, we supplement the experimental results with a simplified numerical model that estimates the corresponding quantum Fisher information. These results support the solid-state NMR platform as a valuable testbed for investigating many-body quantum metrology protocols."}

Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. However, the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ have large code block sizes at high concatenation levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we investigate smaller many-hypercube codes obtained by concatenating $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a surprising fact: $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model.

A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to irreproducible qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity.

We can define the Schur transform as a unitary operation mapping some set of preferred bases of these Krylov subspaces to computational basis states labeling them. We prove that this transformation can be efficiently learned via gradient descent from a set of training data using quantum neural networks, provided that the fragmentation is sufficiently strong such that the summed dimension of the unique Krylov subspaces is polynomial in the system size. To demonstrate this, we analyze the loss landscapes of random quantum neural networks constructed out of Hilbert space fragmented systems. We prove that in this setting, it is possible to eliminate barren plateaus and poor local minima, suggesting efficient trainability when using gradient descent. Furthermore, as the algebra defining the fragmentation is not known a priori and not guaranteed to have sparse algebra elements, to the best of our knowledge there are no existing efficient classical algorithms generally capable of simulating expectation values in these networks. Our setting thus provides a rare example of a physically motivated quantum learning task with no known dequantization."}

This active configuration amplifies quantum correlations within the circuit while preserving the #P-hard Hafnian structure of the output probabilities.

Our approach focuses on thermal relaxation and incorporates these effects into the control protocol, wherein external driving fields not only govern the system's unitary evolution but also modulate its interaction with the environment. By leveraging this interplay, we demonstrate that OCT can enable entropy-modifying processes, such as targeted cooling or heating, while maintaining high-fidelity gate performance in noisy environments.

Although a variety of charging schemes have reported signatures of quantum advantage, the fundamental physical requirements for achieving superextensive charging power remain insufficiently understood. Here, we show that, in addition to Hamiltonian locality, a key structural property, g-extensiveness, quantifying the distribution of interaction energy across lattice sites places a fundamental bound on charging performance in spin-lattice models. We prove that superextensive power scaling is possible only when the interaction-energy distribution becomes increasingly nonuniform, with the maximal local weight growing with system size. This criterion explains why many previously studied protocols fail to exhibit superextensive power, even when the Hamiltonians involve large participation numbers. We further demonstrate that this condition is realized in an experimentally relevant interacting model, where, despite fixed interaction order, the charging power scales superextensively. Our results establish g-extensiveness as a necessary resource for quantum advantage in direct-charging protocols and provide a systematic framework for identifying and engineering physically feasible quantum batteries capable of outperforming classical counterparts in charging power."}

In that context, we study the relationship between particle creation, adiabaticity and irreversibility in terms of three different representations: the initial, the diagonal and the invariant representations of the TDHO. We provide analytical results that are valid for any functional value of the frequency and along the whole evolution of the TDHO, which allows us to monitor the behavior of the thermodynamical magnitudes in regions that are not fully considered in previous works, i.e. the transition and the non quasi-static regions. We supplement the analytical results with numerical calculations and graphs.\n  They both show how the largest modes of the non invariant representations may undergo a process of reversible thermalization, where the concept of temperature naturally arises from the unitary evolution of the oscillator with no relation to any external concept of temperature. It would allow us to monitor an unexpected classical-to-quantum transition, which might entail a violation of the third principle of classical thermodynamics. We also provide adaptations of the customary definitions of the quantum heat and work that account for the particle creation of the TDHO. They thus depend on the representation and their evolution is different for the three representations analyzed in this paper, which might have important consequences in the development of quantum thermal machines. Finally, we study the relationship between the creation of particles and the diagonal entropy, which is derived from the von Neumann entropy in the diagonalization limit.

However, recent works have shown that multiqubit gates can be beneficial for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction and for fault-tolerant stabilizer readout in unrotated surface codes. In this work, we investigate multiqubit Rydberg gates that are useful for fault-tolerant quantum error correction in single-species neutral-atom platforms and can be implemented with a single, non-addressed laser pulse. We develop an open-source Python package to generate analytical, few-parameter pulses that implement the desired gates while minimizing gate errors due to Rydberg-state decay. The tool also allows us to identify parameter-optimal pulses, characterized by a minimal parameter count for the pulse ansatz. Measurement-free quantum error correction protocols require CCZ gates, which we analyze for atoms arranged in symmetric and asymmetric configurations. We investigate the performance of these schemes for various single-, two-, and three-qubit gate error rates, showing that break-even performance of measurement-free QEC is within reach of current hardware. Moreover, we study Floquet quantum error correction protocols that comprise two-body stabilizer measurements. Those can be realized using global three-qubit gates, and we show that this can lead to a significant reduction in shuttling operations. Simulations with realistic circuit-level noise indicate that applying three-qubit gates for stabilizer measurements in Floquet codes can yield competitive logical qubit performance in experimentally relevant error regimes."}

In these systems, effects such as coherence, entanglement, and non-Markovianity play key roles. In this thesis, we explore different ways to describe quantum thermodynamics, using two main approaches: one based on entropy and the other on ergotropy. First, we introduce a generalized approach to quantify non-Markovianity through the breakdown of monotonicity in thermodynamic functions. In this context, the entropy-based heat flow serves as a practical tool to witness and measure quantum memory in unital maps that do not reverse the sign of the internal energy. Next, we analyze the dynamics of ergotropy in open qubits under both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. We identify phenomena such as freezing and sudden death of ergotropy, and we establish an analytical relation between the change in ergotropy and the environment-induced work . This provides a clear physical interpretation for the additional term in the first law in the entropy-based formulation. Finally, we propose an ergotropy-based thermodynamic formulation, in which heat is reinterpreted in terms of the change of the passive state associated with the density operator governing the quantum dynamics. This approach allows one to measure non-Markovianity of unital maps more generally and accurately than the entropy-based heat flow. This advantage comes from the direct link between heat and von Neumann entropy, a property ensured by invariance under passive transformations. Moreover, the out-of-equilibrium temperature naturally remains non-negative, similarly to equilibrium thermodynamics."}

During quantum information scrambling, localized quantum information disperses across the entire system, hiding from the observers who can only access part of it. On the other side, we have a fundamental cryptographic primitive called secret-sharing schemes, where a dealer shares a quantum secret with a group of parties, such that any subset of parties above a specific threshold size can reconstruct it. In this paper, we demonstrate that two protocols, Haar scrambling, which serves as a baseline for other scrambling techniques, and quantum secret sharing, are indeed equivalent. The scheme one gets out of this is of a ramp secret-sharing nature rather than a threshold scheme. We expect this because of the inherent randomness present in Haar unitaries. Moreover, by varying the purity of the initial states, we demonstrate that it is possible to obtain all possible types of ramp secret-sharing schemes. Furthermore, utilizing complexity theoretic arguments, we argue that the protocol can be implemented efficiently, i.e., in polynomial time. Finally, we explore potential applications, ranging from security implications for distributed quantum networks to cryptography in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, and draw insights for fundamental physics, such as many-body physics and quantum black holes."}

For this reason, Richard Feynman proposed the concept of a quantum simulator: quantum systems engineered to obey a prescribed evolution equation and repeating the experiment multiple times. Experimentally, however, as we explain below, the vast majority of observables describing the system are inaccessible. Thus, while Feynman's idea addresses the problem of simulating quantum dynamics, it leaves unsolved the equally fundamental problem of inferring the underlying physics from the limited observables accessible in experiments. Indeed, many complex phenomena associated with QMB systems remain elusive. Perhaps, the most important example is identifying phase transitions in QMB systems when no simple order-parameter exists, which poses major challenges to this day. Complicating the problem further is the fact that, in most cases, it is impossible to learn from numerical simulations, as the underlying systems are often too large to be computable, and small QMB can show strong finite size effects, masking the presence of the transition. Here, we present an unsupervised machine learning approach to study QMB experiments, specifically aimed at detecting phase transitions and crossovers directly from raw experimental measurements. We demonstrate our methodology on systems undergoing Many-Body Localization cross-over and Mott-to-Superfluid phase-transition, showing that it reveals collective phenomena from the very partial experimental data and without any model-specific prior knowledge of the system.

Much of this discrepancy is attributed to the difficulty in discriminating ETPA from various background processes that can mimic its signal, such as linear absorption or scattering. Given this need to certify the presence of ETPA unequivocally, this work introduces a key strategy to isolate the ETPA contribution through its spectral signature. This involves modeling the molecule as a two-photon notch filter and inducing a controlled asymmetric overlap with the joint spectral intensity (JSI) of the incident photons. This asymmetry is used to generate a measurable distortion in the transmitted JSI, and, complementarily, as a reduction in the visibility of the Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) dip. To ensure the experimental feasibility of this technique, a comprehensive analysis of the experimental conditions required for its detection is presented, establishing the absorption efficiency limits that must be overcome given the constraints of entangled-photon-pair flux and detector noise.

The Liouvillian exceptional point (LEP), involving the interplay of energy loss and decoherence inherently relevant to quantum jumps, has recently drawn much attention due to capability to fully capture quantum system dynamics and naturally facilitate non-Hermitian quantum investigations. It was also predicted that quantum jumps could give rise to third-order LEPs in two-level quantum systems for its high dimensional Liouvillian superoperator, which, however, has never been experimentally confirmed until now. Here we report the first observation of the third-order LEPs emerging from quantum jumps in an ultracold two-level trapped-ion system. Moreover, by combining decay with dephasing processes, we present the first experimental exploration of LEPs involving combinatorial effect of decay and dephasing. In particular, due to non-commutativity between the Lindblad superoperators governing LEPs for decay and dephasing, we witness the movement of LEPs driven by the competition between decay and dephasing occurring in an open quantum system. This unique feature of non-Hermitian quantum systems paves a new avenue for modifying nonreciprocity, enhancing precision measurement, and manipulating topological dynamics by tuning the LEPs."}

However, practical applications require techniques capable of reliably distributing entanglement under lossy and noisy conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple configuration using two polarization-maintaining fibers (PMFs) arranged in a cross-axis alignment enables stable distribution of entangled photon pairs without the need for real-time polarization compensation. To support this, we performed quantum information modeling and fidelity simulations for the cross-aligned PMF pair, and experimentally compared the entanglement preservation and interference fringe stability in setups based on standard single-mode fibers (SMFs) and PMFs. The experimental results show that the PMF-based configuration achieves an average visibility of 0.867 and an error propagation of 0.023 under unstable conditions, whereas the SMF setup exhibits a significantly lower stability with an average visibility of 0.444 and an error propagation of 0.167 under the same conditions. These results indicate that the cross-aligned PMF pair allows robust entanglement transmission without complex active compensation devices, suggesting its suitability for reliable quantum state distribution in long-distance quantum communication, drone-based QKD, and multi-user quantum networks."}

We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability."}

However, the reliance of state-of-the-art devices on superconducting materials imposes severe technological demands and challenging operational conditions (e.g., cryogenics), which hinder scalable commercial deployment. To address this, we propose the Enhanced Single-Photon Detector (ESPD) framework, a novel paradigm for achieving high-performance SPDs through the iterative enhancement of low-technology SPDs. Utilizing only standard quantum optical components, the ESPD scheme transforms a legacy non-superconducting SPD, with detection efficiency (DE) about $59\\%$ and dark count rate (DCR) $10^{-2}$, into a device with superior performance metrics, achieving DE higher than $95\\%$ and DCR below $10^{-9}$. This level of performance is comparable to or surpasses recently designed superconducting SPDs, allowing the minimal tolerable channel transmission rate for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) protocols to be reduced by several orders of magnitude. Furthermore, the scheme's device requirements are moderate, relying on readily available current technology, which ensures near-term experimental feasibility. The ESPD framework thus provides a clear, scalable path toward the large-scale deployment of high-performance SPDs and the commercialization of quantum communication technologies."}

Existing work offers no systematic way to verify whether trained QRL policies meet safety requirements under specific noise conditions.\n  We introduce QVerifier, a formal verification method that applies probabilistic model checking to analyze trained QRL policies with and without modeled quantum noise. QVerifier builds a complete model of the policy-environment interaction, incorporates quantum uncertainty directly into the transition probabilities, and then checks safety properties using the Storm model checker.\n  Experiments across multiple QRL environments show that QVerifier precisely measures how different noise models influence safety, revealing both performance degradation and cases where noise can help. By enabling rigorous safety verification before deployment, QVerifier addresses a critical need: because access to quantum hardware is expensive, pre-deployment verification is essential for any safety-critical use of QRL.

As the Standard Model (SM) leaves key questions unanswered and no signs of new physics have emerged since the Higgs boson discovery, advanced experimental and computational tools become necessary. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative to classical methods, and this work investigates three main avenues where quantum algorithms can be useful in HEP research. First, we develop quantum subroutines for computing Minkowski distances and identifying maximum values in unsorted data, inserting them into clustering algorithms such as $k$-means, Affinity Propagation, and $k_T$-jet clustering. These quantum algorithms match classical performance while offering theoretical advantages when implemented on quantum hardware with qRAM. Then, we introduce a novel quantum Monte Carlo integrator, Quantum Fourier Iterative Amplitude Estimation (QFIAE), which combines a quantum neural network with amplitude estimation to integrate multivariate functions. QFIAE is executed on simulators and real quantum computers to evaluate Feynman loop integrals via Loop-Tree Duality, and is extended to compute (partially on hardware) a physical observable at NLO in perturbative quantum field theory. Finally, we present Quantum Chebyshev Probabilistic Models (QCPMs) for modeling multivariate distributions, applying them to fragmentation functions of partons fragmenting into kaons and pions. These models demonstrate accurate generative and interpolation capabilities. We also show how entanglement between variables plays a key role in training, enhancing model accuracy. Overall, these results show how quantum algorithms can already tackle relevant HEP problems on current hardware, while paving the way for future fault-tolerant applications that fully exploit quantum computational advantages."}

Achieving efficient simulations on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and forthcoming Fault-Tolerant Application-Scalable Quantum (FASQ) systems demands a detailed understanding of how computational resources scale with molecular complexity and fermion-to-qubit encoding schemes. In this study, resource requirements for VQE implementations employing the Unitary Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (UCCSD) ansatz are systematically analyzed. The molecular Hamiltonian is formulated in second quantization and mapped to qubit operators through the Jordan-Wigner (JW), Bravyi-Kitaev (BK), and Parity (Pa) transformations.

Certifying hyperentanglement sources work as intended is critical for the hyperentanglement-based quantum information tasks. Self testing is the strongest certification method for quantum state and measurement under minimal assumptions, even without any knowledge of the devices' inner workings. However, the existing self testing protocols all focus on one-DOF entanglement, which cannot self test the multi-DOF entanglement. In the paper, we propose a hyperentanglement self testing framework. We take the self testing for the polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states as an example. The self testing is based on the violation of two-dimension CHSH test in each DOF independently. The two-step swap isometry circuits are proposed for self testing the entanglement in spatial-mode and polarization DOFs, respectively. All the sixteen polarization-spatial-mode hyperentangled Bell states can be self tested. Our hyperentanglement self testing framework has three advantages. First, it is a general hyperentanglement self testing framework, and can be extended to self test multi-DOF hyperentanglement and multipartite hyperentanglement. Second, it can provide the robust hyperentanglement self testing and establish the relation between the lower bound of fidelity and the imperfect violation of Bell-like inequality in each DOF. Third, it is feasible with current experimental technology.

In particular, modeling two-dimensional systems with realistic long-range interactions, in addition to dissipation, is of vital importance to the development of modern quantum computing and simulation platforms. In this paper, we present a construction of the time-evolution operator, as a projected entangled pair operator (denoted tePEPO), that can be used to evolve a tensor network ansatz through time. Interactions beyond nearest-neighbor, including interactions between sites not collinear in the lattice, can be represented efficiently as a tePEPO. Furthermore, we obtain approximations to realistic radial long-range interactions decaying with a power-law, that give accurate results with small tePEPO bond dimension. Finally, we consider a physical example of a Rydberg atom Hamiltonian with long-range dipolar interactions, and show evidence of a dipole-dipole blockading effect in presence of dissipation. This work demonstrates the applicability of tensor networks to two-dimensional systems widely studied in experiments, but previously inaccessible to non-semi-classical methods."}

We introduce an ancilla-free hybrid classical-quantum strategy that reduces this cost to $O(poly(n))$ for a broad class of compressible data. The method first applies a classical compression step to obtain a $d$-sparse representation of the input, loads this sparse vector using a sparse-state preparation routine, and then reconstructs the target state through a polynomial-depth quantum inverse transform. We evaluate the framework on synthetic benchmark signals and real biomedical time series using Fourier and Haar transforms, demonstrating substantial reductions in CNOT counts and circuit depth compared to EAE, together with competitive performance relative to the Fourier Series Loader (FSL). The quantum simulation results show that combining classical data compression with quantum decompression provides a scalable framework for efficient QSP, reducing quantum overhead without requiring variational training or ancillary registers."}

Distributed quantum computing (DQC) addresses this challenge by interconnecting smaller quantum nodes through quantum communication protocols, enabling collaborative computation. While several experimental and theoretical proposals for DQC exist, emulator platforms are essential tools for exploring their feasibility under realistic conditions. In this work, we introduce a benchmarking framework to evaluate DQC emulators using a distributed implementation of the inverse Quantum Fourier Transform ($\\mathrm{QFT}^{\\dagger}$) as a representative test case, which enables efficient phase recovery from pre-encoded Fourier states. The QFT is partitioned across nodes using teleportation-based protocols, and performance is analyzed in terms of execution time, memory usage, and fidelity with respect to a monolithic baseline.\n  As part of this work, we review a broad range of emulators, identifying their capabilities and limitations for programming distributed quantum algorithms. Many platforms either lacked support for teleportation protocols or required complex workarounds. Consequently, we select and benchmark four representative emulators: Qiskit Aer, SquidASM, Interlin-q, and SQUANCH. They differ significantly in their support for discrete-event simulation, quantum networking, noise modeling, and parallel execution. Our results highlight the trade-offs between architectural fidelity and simulation scalability, providing a foundation for future emulator development and the validation of distributed quantum protocols. This framework can be extended to support additional algorithms and emulators."}

This invariance uniquely identifies the internal Hamiltonian.

It supports next-generation computing architectures that provide improved scalability and enhanced computational efficiency. Within these architectures, the decimal adder is a key arithmetic component, particularly for Binary Coded Decimal (BCD) operations widely used in financial and commercial systems. However, most reversible BCD adders focus primarily on quantum and reversible metrics, overlooking the critical influence of delay, which makes balanced optimization a significant challenge. This paper presents two reversible BCD adder designs optimized for both delay and quantum cost. One design integrates the decimal carry-skip technique to improve the overall delay. Using reversible logic gates, the proposed architectures efficiently perform BCD addition and implement the required correction logic while maintaining full reversibility. Evaluation results indicate that the proposed designs surpass existing reversible BCD adders, achieving best-case average improvements of 85.12% in delay and 30.75% in quantum cost. These advancements demonstrate the potential of the proposed adders for integration into future quantum-based arithmetic units and scalable reversible computing systems. Moreover, analysis of real banking transaction data underscores the practical importance of BCD addition and its widespread use in accurate and efficient monetary computations."}

By introducing tolerance to fabrication defects into the design of the quantum devices, we can improve the yield of usable quantum chips and lower the cost of useful systems. Automated Compilation Including Dropouts (ACID) is a framework that works in the ancilla-free (or `middle-out') paradigm, to generate syndrome extraction circuits for general stabiliser codes in the presence of defective couplers or qubits. In the ancilla-free paradigm, we do not designate particular qubits as measurement ancillas, instead measuring stabilisers using any of the data qubits in their support. This approach leads to a great deal of flexibility in how syndrome extraction circuits can be implemented. ACID works by constructing and solving an optimisation problem within the ancilla-free paradigm to find a short syndrome extraction circuit. Applied to the surface code, ACID produces syndrome-extraction circuits of depth between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $1.5\\times$ relative to the depth of defect-free circuits. The LUCI algorithm, the best prior art, yielded a $2 \\times$ overhead, so ACID offers a significant time saving. The yield of surface code chips with a logical error rate at most $10\\times$ the dropout-free baseline is up to $3\\times$ higher using ACID than using LUCI. I demonstrate the broad applicability of ACID by compiling syndrome extraction circuits for bivariate bicycle codes and the colour code. For these circuits, we incur a circuit-depth overhead of between $1\\times$ (no overhead) and $2.5\\times$ relative to defect-free circuits. I believe this work is the first to simulate both of these families of codes in the presence of fabrication defects."}

Although embedding nonlinear materials within resonant structures allows for the enhancement and tailoring of photon properties, accurately modeling these quantum interactions remains a challenge. In this work, we apply the asymptotic-fields formalism, an approach based on scattering theory, to describe nonlinear optical processes within a Fabry-Pérot cavity. Unlike previous applications of this formalism, we explicitly account for reflections in the system. We derive the interaction Hamiltonian and calculate photon-pair generation rates using perturbation theory. The versatility of this model is illustrated through three examples: (i) spontaneous parametric down-conversion in an idealized cavity with flat-response mirrors; (ii) the generation of counter-propagating photon pairs in a periodically-poled material; and (iii) spontaneous four-wave mixing in a cavity built with Bragg reflectors."}
