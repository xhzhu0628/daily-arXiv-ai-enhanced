We find that the peculiar coupling matrix in cross-shaped arrays\nyields a significant enhancement of the magnetic flux response compared to\nlinear arrays, this network-topology effect arising from cooperative coupling\namong the central and the peripheral qubits. These results establish\nquantitative design criteria for function-oriented superconducting quantum\ncircuits, with direct implications for advancing performance in both quantum\nsensing and quantum information processing applications. Concerning the latter,\nby exploiting the non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics of such arrays, we\ndemonstrate their suitability for quantum reservoir computing technology. This\ndual functionality suggests a novel platform in which the same device serves\nboth as a quantum-limited electromagnetic sensor and as a reservoir capable of\nsignal processing, enabling integrated quantum sensing and processing\narchitectures."}

Classical shadow estimation offers favorable sample complexity, but\ntypically relies on many-qubit circuits that are difficult to realize on\ncurrent platforms. We propose the robust phase shadow scheme, a measurement\nframework based on random circuits with controlled-Z as the unique entangling\ngate type, tailored to architectures such as trapped ions and neutral atoms.\nLeveraging tensor diagrammatic reasoning, we rigorously analyze the induced\ncircuit ensemble and show that phase shadows match the performance of full\nClifford-based ones. Importantly, our approach supports a noise-robust\nextension via purely classical post-processing, enabling reliable estimation\nunder realistic, gate-dependent noise where existing techniques often fail.\nAdditionally, by exploiting structural properties of random stabilizer states,\nwe design an efficient post-processing algorithm that resolves a key\ncomputational bottleneck in previous shadow protocols. Our results enhance the\npracticality of shadow-based techniques, providing a robust and scalable route\nfor estimating global properties in noisy quantum systems."}

However, not only are\nquantum optical and atomic systems often treated separately, but even within\nquantum optics, identifying optimal probes (quantum states) and evolutions\n(parameter-dependent dynamics) typically relies on case-by-case analyses. Mode,\nand sometimes only particle entanglement, can yield quantum enhancement of\nprecision in continuous- and discrete-variable regimes, yet a clear connection\nbetween these regimes remains elusive. In this work, we present a unified\nframework for quantum metrology that encompasses all known precision-enhancing\nregimes using bosonic resources. We introduce a superselection rule compliant\nrepresentation of the electromagnetic field that explicitly incorporates the\nphase reference, enforcing total particle number conservation. This approach\nprovides a description of the electromagnetic field which is formally\nequivalent to the one employed in atomic systems, and we show how it\nencompasses both the discrete and the continuous limits of quantum optics.\nWithin this framework, we consistently recover established results while\noffering a coherent physical interpretation of the quantum resources\nresponsible for precision enhancement. Moreover, we develop general strategies\nto optimize precision using arbitrary multimode entangled probe states.\nFinally, our formalism readily accommodates noise, measurement strategies and\nnon-unitary evolutions, extending its applicability to realistic experimental\nscenarios."}

Accurate quantification of nitrogen\nconcentration is therefore essential for optimizing diamond-based quantum\ndevices.

In this work, we use a helium ion microscope to fabricate nanoscale NV\ncenter ensembles at predefined sites in a diamond crystal containing low\nconcentrations of nitrogen. We then utilize these NV-based probes to measure\nthe local nitrogen concentration on the level of 230 ppb (atomic parts per\nbillion) using the double electron-electron resonance (DEER) technique.\nMoreover, by comparing the DEER spectra with numerical simulations, we managed\nto determine the concentration of other unknown paramagnetic defects created\nduring the ion implantation, reaching 15 ppb depending on the implantation\ndose."}
