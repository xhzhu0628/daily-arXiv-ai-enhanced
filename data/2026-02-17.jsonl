We prove that the Gibbs state of any quantum spin chain can be exactly decomposed into a mixture of matrix product states with a bond dimension that is independent of the system size, at any finite temperature. As a consequence, the Schmidt number, arguably the most stringent measure of bipartite entanglement, is strictly finite for thermal states, even in the thermodynamic limit. Our decomposition is explicit and is accompanied by an efficient classical algorithm to sample the resulting matrix product states."}

Motivated by this goal, we study several classes of fault-tolerant gadget constructions consisting of Clifford gates acting on the physical qubits, including transversal gadgets, code automorphisms, and fold-transversal gadgets. While stabilizer codes encoding a single logical qubit, most notably the [[7,1,3]] Steane code, are known to admit transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group, no analogous examples are known for codes encoding multiple logical qubits. In this work, we prove a no-go theorem establishing that no stabilizer code admits a fully transversal implementation of the Clifford group on more than one logical qubit. We further strengthen this result by showing that fold-transversal implementations of the full logical Clifford group are impossible for stabilizer codes encoding more than two logical qubits. More generally, we introduce the notion of k-fold transversal gadgets and prove that implementing the full Clifford group on k logical qubits requires at least k-fold transversal gadgets at the physical level. In addition, we analyze code-automorphism based constructions and demonstrate that they also fail to realize the full Clifford group on multiple logical qubits for any stabilizer code. Together, these results place fundamental constraints on fault-tolerant Clifford gadget design and show that stabilizer codes supporting the full logical Clifford group on multiple logical qubits via these architectures do not exist. Since the Clifford group is a core component of universal gate sets, our findings imply that quantum computing with codes encoding multiple logical qubits within a single code block necessarily entails more complex constructions for fault tolerance."}

The issue regarding the additional rotating wave approximation was left as an open problem.\n  The present work addresses the open problem and presents new results. We identify a discrepancy in the popular and standard Redfield equation. The discrepancy is associated with the well-known fact that the Redfield equation does not represent a proper quantum map. The discrepancy is related to the diagrammatic expansion and a consistency requirement in the quasi-particle approximation. The explicit resolution of this discrepancy is obtained by imposing energy conservation on the Born level. As a result we obtain formal equivalence between the energy-conserving Redfield equation and the Lindblad equation without invoking the rotating wave approximation. We provide a detailed mapping of the field theoretical approach to the standard microscopic derivation in the theory of open quantum systems."}

Free-space propagation and objective-lens aberrations are implemented via two-dimensional quantum Fourier transforms (QFTs) and diagonal phase operators in reciprocal space, while specimen interaction is modeled under the weak phase object approximation (WPOA) as a position-dependent phase grating. We validate projected potentials, contrast transfer function (CTF) behavior, and image contrast trends against classical multislice simulations for MoS$_2$ over experimentally relevant parameters, and provide resource estimates and key assumptions that determine end-to-end runtime. While extracting complete $N\\times N$ intensity images requires $O(N^2/ε^2)$ measurements that preclude advantage for full-image reconstruction, the framework enables quantum advantage for tasks requiring Fourier-space queries, global image statistics, or phase-coherent observables inaccessible to classical intensity-only detection. This framework provides a physics-grounded mapping from CTEM theory to quantum circuits and establishes a baseline for extending toward full multislice and inelastic scattering models."}

While quantum algorithms for the standard DFT are well established, a corresponding framework for the non-uniform case remains underdeveloped. This work introduces a quantum algorithm for the Non-Uniform Quantum Fourier Transform (NUQFT) based on a low-rank factorization of the NUDFT matrix. The factorization is translated into an explicit quantum construction using block encodings, Quantum Signal Processing, and the Linear Combination of Unitaries framework, yielding an $ε$-accurate block encoding of the NUDFT matrix with controlled approximation error from both classical truncation and quantum implementation. Under standard oracle access assumptions for non-uniform sampling points, we derive explicit, non-asymptotic gate-level resource estimates. The resulting complexity scales polylogarithmically with target precision, quadratically with the number of qubits through the quantum Fourier transform, and logarithmically with a geometry-dependent conditioning parameter induced by the non-uniform grid. This establishes a concrete and resource-efficient quantum analogue of the NUDFT and provides a foundation for quantum algorithms on irregularly sampled data."}

Solving ILPs is \\textsf{NP-Hard} yet of great practical importance. Super-quadratic quantum speedups for ILPs have been difficult to obtain because classical algorithms for many-constraint ILPs are global and exhaustive, whereas quantum frameworks that offer super-quadratic speedup exploit local structure of the objective and feasible set. We address this via quantum algorithms for Gomory's group relaxation. The group relaxation of an ILP is obtained by dropping nonnegativity on variables that are positive in the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation, while retaining integrality of the decision variables. We present a competitive feasibility-preserving classical local-search algorithm for the group relaxation, and a corresponding quantum algorithm that, under reasonable technical conditions, achieves a super-quadratic speedup. When the group relaxation satisfies a nondegeneracy condition analogous to, but stronger than, LP non-degeneracy, our approach yields the optimal solution to the original ILP. Otherwise, the group relaxation tightens bounds on the optimal objective value of the ILP, and can improve downstream branch-and-cut by reducing the integrality gap; we numerically observe this on several practically relevant ILPs. To achieve these results, we derive efficiently constructible constraint-preserving mixers for the group relaxation with favorable spectral properties, which are of independent interest."}

Moreover, a resource-cost analysis indicates that our protocols, which avoid quantum teleportation whenever possible, can reduce the entanglement consumption.

Eliminating the Kerr nonlinearity is advantageous for quantum-limited amplification, as it mitigates unwanted distortions in squeezing and prevents degradation of both gain and quantum efficiency in the high-gain strong drive regime. By replacing the central junction in the symmetrically threaded SQUIDs (STS) configuration with a linear inductor, we find that the Kerr-nonlinearity can be eliminated and the effective Hamiltonian reduces to that of a degenerate parametric amplifier (DPA), up to higher-order corrections in the zero-point fluctuations of the superconducting phase operator. We show that the deviations from ideal DPA behavior introduced by these higher-order terms are significantly weaker than those associated with a Kerr nonlinearity. Consequently, the STS design can be driven strongly while maintaining near-quantum-limited performance at the Kerr-free point. Our analysis predicts phase-preserving gain and efficiency approaching the quantum limit, with robust operation demonstrated up to 25 dB of gain."}

This two-magnon interference, i.e., a magnonic analog to the photonic Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, is supported by a tunable magnonic beamsplitter operation formed in a hybrid cavity magnonic system comprising a pair of mutually coupled magnon modes. By applying a time-dependent magnetic field, magnons can be excited independently in each mode and subsequently brought into interaction, shifting from independent to collective oscillations, to realize a controllable magnonic beamsplitter. When the beamsplitter operation is applied to an initially unentangled two-magnon state, a maximally entangled magnonic $N00N$ state with tunable phase sensitivity is produced. These findings suggest that two-magnon interference in hybrid cavity magnonic systems may enable novel quantum metrological devices to study fundamental magnon dynamics and contribute to developing hybrid magnonic quantum computing architectures."}

The subpulses act as discrete samples of the underlying continuous evolution; consequently, more complex population dynamics, characterized by multiple oscillations prior to the onset of adiabaticity, require a larger number of subpulses for accurate reproduction.

Rather than viewing the SR-CC cluster operator solely as a device for reproducing one target state, we consider more general constructions in which different components of the cluster operator play distinct roles, ranging from encoding states of different symmetry than the reference to enabling SR-CC Ansatz to describe multiple states simultaneously. These developments lead to a new class of SR-CC downfolding formalisms in which the resulting active-space effective Hamiltonians are capable of concurrently representing multiple correlated states nonorthogonal to the reference function. We establish three theorems that formalize this extension and demonstrate that standard CC downfolding emerges as a special case of the proposed framework.

However, direct characterization of non-classical light at damage-threshold intensities remains an open question. Here, we theoretically investigate the impact of photon-number fluctuations of squeezed light on strong-field photoelectron holography using a quantum-optical strong-field approximation. We identify a mechanism, ponderomotive dephasing, whereby the inherent quantum fluctuations of the driving field dictate the stability of the electron's semiclassical action. While amplitude-squeezed light stabilizes the action to enhance holographic contrast, phase-squeezed light amplifies photon-number noise, causing a rapid collapse of fringe visibility. This quantum-optical sensitivity follows a steep quartic wavelength scaling, rendering mid-infrared drivers uniquely sensitive to the field's underlying quantum nature. Crucially, we show that the collapse of holographic contrast is not a loss of information but a metrological gain. By evaluating the Classical Fisher Information, we identify a \"dark-port\" mechanism in the tunneling tail that enables the estimation of field quadrature noise beyond the Standard Quantum Limit. This fundamental trade-off between structural imaging fidelity and statistical sensitivity establishes the framework for Attosecond Quantum Tomography: an in-situ, reference-free protocol to reconstruct the Wigner distribution of intense quantum light.

At zero- to ultralow-field (ZULF) conditions, differences in frequency between nuclear spins of different types are quenched and the internal Hamiltonians can be closely approximated by an isotropic Heisenberg model. In this work, we present [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as a chemically engineered nuclear spin chain whose full spin-spin coupling network can be determined and validated by combining high-field NMR detection with evolution at ultralow fields. Starting from high-field (16.4 T) NMR spectra of $^1$H, $^{13}$C, and $^{15}$N nuclei, we extract all relevant $J$-couplings within a 12-spin network (four $^{13}$C, one $^{15}$N, and seven $^1$H). We then employ a mechanical field-cycling apparatus to prepolarize the spins at high field, shuttle them into a magnetically shielded region for evolution at <50 nT, and detect signals after returning to high field. Fourier analysis of the ultralow-field evolution yields indirect $J$-spectra that are conceptually analogous to ZULF NMR spectra but measured by a high-field NMR spectrometer. We observe clear spectral features at $J$, 1.5$J$, and 2$J$, in good agreement with simulations using the extracted coupling matrix. Finally, we demonstrate 2D experiments that correlate high-field chemical shifts and, thus, fully map interactions within the molecular spin chain. Our results establish [U-$^{13}$C,$^{15}$N]-butyronitrile as an extremely well-characterized spin chain model system and provide a quantitative Hamiltonian benchmark for future hyperpolarization and quantum-control studies."}

To relax this bottleneck, we investigate a six-wave mixing (SWM)-based Rydberg atomic receiver as a wideband radio frequency (RF)-to-optical quantum transducer. Specifically, we develop an explicit baseband input-output model spanning from the probe input to the output light field. Based upon this model, a closed-form 3-dB bandwidth expression is derived to expose its dependence on key optical and RF parameters. We further quantify the linear dynamic range by employing the 1-dB compression point (P1dB) and the input-referred third-order intercept point (IIP3), unveiling a communication-compatible characterization of the bandwidth-linearity trade-off. Finally, our numerical results demonstrate that, given identical optical driving conditions, the SWM configuration increases the 3-dB baseband bandwidth by more than an order of magnitude compared to the EIT-based counterpart, while retaining comparable electric-field sensitivity and revealing a broad, tunable linear operating region."}

By establishing an explicit geometrical correspondence between local measurements and topological surgery operations on an associated link model i.e. a measurement surgery correspondence, we represent the cluster state as a linear Hopf chain. Within this model, measurements in the computational ($Z$) basis act as topological severance in case of bulk measurements while boundary pruning happens for end measurements of qubits. In contrast, transverse ($X$) basis measurements remove the measured qubit while splicing its neighbours, preserving connectivity through real valued correlations. We show that lateral ($Y$) basis measurements also preserve connectivity but generate intrinsically complex phase factors that are not captured by unframed link models, rendering X and Y measurements topologically indistinguishable at the level of connectivity alone. To resolve this ambiguity, we introduce a framed ribbon representation in which quantum phases are encoded as geometric twists, with chiral $\\pm 90^\\circ} twists corresponding to the phases $\\pm i$. This framing yields a phase-sensitive and outcome resolved topological description of all single qubit measurements on linear cluster states. Our approach provides a unified geometric interpretation of measurement-induced entanglement transformations in measurement-based quantum computation, revealing that quantum phases correspond directly to framed topological invariants. The work is restricted to one-dimensional linear cluster states and single-qubit measurements in the Pauli bases."}

Existing schemes that harness internal atomic degrees of freedom to boost squeezing typically encode the collective squeezing in complex superpositions of magnetic sublevels, which complicates state control and limits practical applications.

Our protocol sandwiches a quantum non-demolition measurement between two internal one-axis-twisting interactions arranged in an echo sequence. We show that this approach can optimally leverage internal states to boost the inter-atom entanglement and, at the same time, encode it in two magnetic sublevels, which is readily convertible into metrologically useful spin squeezing.

We show how non-Hermiticity arises in an open quantum system with an infinite environment, focusing on the one-body problem. One of the reasons for taking the present approach is that we can solve the problem completely, making it easier to see the structures of problems involving open quantum systems. We show that this results in the discovery of a new complete set, which is one of the main topics of the present article. Another reason for focusing on the one-body problem is that the theory permits the strong coupling between the system and the environment. In the current research landscape, it is valuable to revisit the one-body problem for open quantum systems, which can be solved accurately for arbitrary strengths of the system-environment couplings. A rigorous understanding of the problem structures in the present approach will be helpful when we tackle problems with many-body interactions. First, we consider potential scattering and directly define the resonant state as an eigenstate of the Schrödinger equation under the Siegert outgoing boundary condition. We show that the resonant eigenstate can have a complex energy eigenvalue, even though the Hamiltonian is seemingly Hermitian. Second, we introduce the Feshbach formalism, which eliminates the infinite degrees of freedom of the environment and represents its effect as a complex potential. The resulting effective Hamiltonian is explicitly non-Hermitian. By unifying these two ways of defining resonant states, we obtain a new complete set of bases for the scattering problem that contains all discrete eigenstates, including resonant states. We finally mention the non-Markovian dynamics of open quantum systems. We emphasize the time-reversal symmetry of the dynamics that continuously connects the past and the future. We can capture it using the new complete set that we develop here."}

One of the qubits acts as the battery and the other acts as the charger which is subjected to a reservoir. We derived the time-local master equation in Lindblad form with a time-dependent dephasing rate. The dephasing rate may be negative in the early-stage of the charging process and thus indicate the presence of the memory effect. We find that such early-stage memory effect could increase the maximal ergotropy of the battery compared with the one under Markovian approximation with the corresponding asymptotic dephase rate. The enhancement of the performance is explained by means of the non-Markovian quantum jumps. Moreover, a discrete time scheme of the measurement-enhanced quantum battery is proposed in a quantum circuit with global and random local operations."}

However, entanglement engineering between multiple modes is strongly suppressed by dark mode effect. Here, we proposed a scheme based on molecular cavity optomechanical structure that enhances quantum bipartite and tripartite entanglement via dark mode breaking. Our proposal consists of an optical cavity that hosts two molecular ensembles which are coupled through an intermolecular coupling. A vibrational hopping rate $J_m$ captures the intermolecular coupling that is phase modulated via the synthetic gauge field method. The breaking of the dark mode is controlled by tuning both the intermolecular coupling and its modulation phase. By adjusting these parameters in our proposal, we can flexibly switch between the Dark Mode Unbroken (DMU) and the Dark Mode Broken (DMB) regimes. We find that in the dark-mode-unbroken regime, the amount of the generated bipartite and tripartite entanglement is significantly low or is suppressed. In contrast, in the dark-mode-broken regime, the entanglement is greatly enhanced,i.e., up to twofold enhancement. Moreover, the generated entanglement is more resilient against thermal noise in the dark-mode-broken regime compared to the thermal robustness in the unbroken regime. Therefore, our proposed scheme serves as a benckmark system to improve quantum correlations engineering, and to generate noise-tolerant quantum resources for applications in numerous modern quantum technologies."}

When the magnetic fields are biomagnetic ones, i.e., they contain some private information, the information of from who non-zero magnetic fields occur has to be protected from eavesdroppers. Anonymous quantum sensing keeps it secret by estimating amplitudes of the magnetic fields without disclosing the positions of non-zero magnetic fields. In this paper, we propose an anonymous quantum sensing protocol that is robust against any independent noise in state preparations. To this end, we devise a quantum state verification protocol for a superposition of Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and Dicke states and combine it with the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing. Our verification protocol can decide whether the fidelity between the ideal and actual states is high or low more efficiently than the direct fidelity estimation. Since the original protocol of anonymous quantum sensing cannot correctly estimate the amplitudes of the magnetic fields under state preparation errors, our results would improve the performance of anonymous quantum sensing in realistic situations."}

The output state remains diagonal in photon-number basis, making photon counting globally optimal and saturating the multiparameter quantum Cramér-Rao bound without adaptive feedback. Moving beyond ideal unitary evolution, we analyze protocol robustness under concurrent amplitude and phase damping. Using Fisher Information Susceptibility, we establish a clear hierarchy: NOON states offer maximal theoretical sensitivity but exhibit exponential fragility to loss, rendering them impractical. Squeezed vacuum states emerge as robust candidates for steady-state sensing, while cat states prove compelling for transient thermometry by retaining significant coherence after photon loss. We validate these predictions through digital quantum circuit implementation on IBM's \\texttt{ibm_torino} processor.

The same platform offers a tunable, low-cost testbed for stress-testing Bell/CHSH and contextuality witnesses under realistic imperfections (noise, coarse binning, selective sampling). We also outline an alternative preparation based on external conical refraction (ECR), where engineered intersecting conical-refraction rings mimic the intersecting emission cones of SPDC. We give a self-contained categorical formulation: the preparation-and-conditioning pipeline (Hadamard-like splitting, CNOT-like coupling, and routing/conditioning that removes unwanted contributions) is treated as a single morphism in an operational process theory (e.g. $\\mathbf{CPM}(\\mathbf{FHilb})$). From it we functorially extract an empirical model, i.e. a compatible family of context-indexed probability distributions. The Abramsky--Brandenburger sheaf criterion then applies: noncontextuality is the existence of a global section, and CHSH violation is a precise failure-to-glue.

FPINN employs a shared base network with independent branches, isolating gradient pathways to stabilize training. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FPINN in simulating non-Markovian open quantum dynamics governed by coupled DEs, where multi-objective conflicts and local optima traps often cause evolutionary stagnation.

This has resulted in the neglect of spin relaxation due to spin-spin dipolar interactions and its influence on decoherence at low temperatures. For a complete understanding of low temperature spin dynamics, it is then imperative to focus also on the latter mechanism. One such method which has shown great promise in the efficient calculation of central spin dynamics due to spin-spin dipolar interactions with a surrounding spin bath is the Cluster-Correlation Expansion (CCE). An extension of this method through the explicit inclusion of the central spin degrees of freedom, known as the generalized Cluster-Correlation Expansion (gCCE) is capable of simulating the transfer of energy from the central spin into the bath, and thus could have the potential to investigate spin relaxation in this setting. In this work, we show that gCCE, in its standard form, is insufficient for providing even a qualitatively accurate description of spin-spin relaxation. A full mathematical deconstruction of the underlying theory of gCCE clearly points to the origin of such a breakdown and provides a starting point for its potential future resolution."}

In this work, we investigate quantum reservoir computing (QRC), using both noiseless emulation and hardware execution on the neutral-atom Rydberg processor \\textit{Aquila}. We evaluate performance with six classical machine-learning models and use SHAP to generate feature subsets. We find that models trained on emulated quantum features achieve mean test accuracies comparable to those trained on classical features, but have higher training accuracies and greater variability over data splits, consistent with overfitting. When comparing hardware execution of QRC to noiseless emulation, the models are more robust over different data splits and often exhibit statistically significant improvements in mean test accuracy. This combination of improved accuracy and increased stability is suggestive of a regularising effect induced by hardware execution. To investigate the origin of this behaviour, we examine the statistical differences between hardware and emulated quantum feature distributions. We find that hardware execution applies a structured, time-dependent transformation characterised by compression toward the mean and a progressive reduction in mutual information relative to emulation."}

Particular emphasis is given both to understanding states in a basis-independent way and to understanding how probability amplitudes and density matrix elements used to algebraically represent states in a particular basis correspond to line segments and angles in the geometric representations.

We show that an appropriate tuning of the system and feedback parameters leads to a substantial reduction of the estimation errors associated with both coupling strengths. To quantify the metrological performance of the proposed scheme, we employ the quantum Cramer Rao bound (QCRB) as a fundamental benchmark for multiparameter estimation. We explicitly compute and compare the QCRBs derived from the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD) and the right logarithmic derivative (RLD) formalisms. Our results demonstrate that the RLD based QCRB is systematically lower than the SLD based bound, indicating superior estimation precision in the considered noncommutative estimation scenario. We further analyze the performance of heterodyne detection and show that, in suitable parameter regimes, the corresponding classical estimation precision closely approaches the ultimate quantum limit predicted by our scheme.

We experimentally verify these assumptions in our processor by implementing the protocols on one- and three-qubit subsystems; here, shadow Lindblad tomography reproduces extensible Lindblad tomography within uncertainties while using exponentially fewer configurations. Leveraging this efficiency, we apply shadow Lindblad tomography to the full five-qubit processor and recover all single qubit dissipation and two-qubit coupling parameters in 9 hours of acquisition time compared to an estimated 58 hours for extensible Lindblad tomography. Additionally, our shadow implementation is compatible with conventional Gaussian error propagation, avoiding the use of median-of-means estimators. Together, these results demonstrate how randomized shadow tomography protocols can be practically implemented to learn quantum processor dynamics at an increasing qubit count."}

An open question is whether similar behavior arises when non-reciprocity originates at the Liouvillian level rather than from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian obtained via post-selection. Here we investigate this scenario in a lattice model with globally reciprocal Liouvillian dynamics and locally asymmetric incoherent hopping, a disordered setting in which Liouvillian-specific effects have remained largely unexplored. While the steady state again shows disorder-dependent, erratic localization without boundary accumulation, we find that global reciprocity in the Liouvillian does not protect transport. Instead, in the regime dominated by incoherent hopping, excitations spread via Sinai-type subdiffusion, dramatically slower than the ordinary diffusion found in symmetric stochastic lattices. Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between globally reciprocal Hamiltonian and Liouvillian dynamics: global reciprocity suppresses the skin effect in both cases, but only in Liouvillian dynamics can it coexist with ultra-slow, disorder-induced subdiffusive transport."}

While optimal decoding is generally NP-hard, we propose a faster decoder exploiting the structural properties of the underlying graph states. Although distinct error patterns may yield the same syndrome, we demonstrate that the post-measurement state follows a well-defined structure determined by the projective syndrome measurement. Building on this idea, we introduce a hierarchical decoder in which each level can be solved in polynomial time. Additionally, this decoder achieves optimal decoding performance at the lower levels of the hierarchy. This strategy avoids the need for full maximum-likelihood decoding of graph codes. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed approach."}

These include projections of bipartite positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices onto the set of PSD matrices with a given marginal, and projections of ensembles of PSD matrices onto the set of PSD decompositions of a given matrix, with important special cases corresponding to projections onto the set of quantum channels (via the Choi isomorphism) and onto the set of measurements. We introduce prior-channel decompositions of completely positive (CP) maps, which uniquely decompose any CP map into a prior PSD matrix and a quantum channel. This decomposition generalizes the Choi-Jamiolkowski isomorphism by establishing a bijective correspondence between arbitrary bipartite PSD matrices and channel-state pairs, and we show that it arises naturally from the fidelity projections developed here. As applications, we show that the pretty good measurement - associated with a weighted ensemble - is the fidelity projection of the ensemble onto the set of measurements, and that the Petz recovery map - associated with a reference state and forward channel - is the projection of a CP map (constructed from the channel-state pair) onto the set of reverse quantum channels, thereby recasting the well-known identification of the Petz map with quantum Bayes' rule in information-geometric terms.

This study investigates how much class information remains accessible under locality-constrained measurements in the presence of noise. The authors formulate binary quantum classification as constrained quantum state discrimination and introduce a locality-restricted distinguishability measure quantifying the maximum bias achievable by observables acting on at most $k$ subsystems. For $n$-qubit systems subject to independent depolarizing noise, the locally accessible signal is governed by a Pauli-weight-dependent contraction mechanism. This motivates a computable predictor, the $k$-local Pauli-accessible amplitude $A_{k}(p)$, which lower bounds the optimal $k$-local classification advantage. Numerical experiments on four-qubit encodings demonstrate quantitative agreement between empirical accuracy and the prediction across noise levels. The research identifies an operational breakdown threshold where $k$-local classifiers become indistinguishable from random guessing despite persistent global distinguishability."}

Each memristor consists of an integrated Mach-Zehnder interferometer whose transfer function is adaptively updated by photon detection events on another memristor, thus generating novel non-Markovian input-output dynamics with an enhanced memristive behaviour compared to single devices. In particular, we report inter-memristor input-output hysteresis curves exhibiting larger form factors and displaying self-intersecting loops, respectively revealing marked bistability and topologically non-trivial memory dynamics. Furthermore, numerical simulations show how these features emerge from the interplay between memory depth and relative input phase, for both intra- and inter-memristor input-output relations.

Since heralded entanglement generation attempts succeed only probabilistically, some links will have to be stored in quantum memories at the nodes of the chain while waiting for adjacent links to be generated. The fidelity of these stored links decreases with time due to decoherence, and if they are stored for too long then this can lead to low end-to-end fidelity. Previous work has shown that the end-to-end fidelity can be improved by deterministically discarding links when their ages exceed some cutoff value. Such deterministic cutoff policies provide strict control of the fidelity of all links, but they come at the expense of having to track link ages. In this work, we introduce a probabilistic cutoff policy that does not require tracking link ages, at the cost of abandoning strict control of the fidelity. We benchmark this new probabilistic cutoff policy against a deterministic cutoff policy. We compare the policies in terms of the end-to-end rate and fidelity, and the secret-key rate. We find that even though the probabilistic cutoff policy keeps track of less state, it can provide secret-key rates of the same order of magnitude as the deterministic cutoff policy in chains with few nodes or high elementary link generation probabilities. Moreover, we identify a scenario in which the probabilistic cutoff policy can deliver end-to-end links that are required to have some minimum threshold fidelity at a higher rate than the deterministic cutoff policy."}

In the context of the SU(1,1) group, sub-Planck features have been constructed through the superposition of four Perelomov coherent states on the hyperbolic plane (the SU(1,1) compass state). However, these structures differ in scale along different phase-space directions, resulting in nonuniform sensitivity enhancement. We overcome this limitation by constructing $\\overline{n}$-component compass states, which are obtained by superposing $\\overline{n} \\geq 6$ SU(1,1) coherent states, with an even total number, evenly arranged along a circular path on the hyperbolic plane; that is, all components lie at the same distance from the origin and have equal angular spacing of $\\frac{2π}{\\overline{n}}$. These generalized SU(1,1) compass states generate circularly shaped sub-Planck features (isotropic sub-Planckness) and provide uniform enhancement in sensitivity to phase-space displacements. As the number of coherent states $\\overline{n}$ increases, these refinements progressively improve.

In open boundary conditions, we show that the LT can be written exactly as the covariance of a bivariate probability distribution built from density-density correlations. This leads to two conceptually distinct extensions to PBC: (i) a geometric one based on the Riemannian center (Frechet mean) on the circle, and (ii) a metric-free one based on the mutual information I, which treats the configuration space purely as a probability space. We then relate the LT to the static structure factor by identifying the diagonal part, Cpp, as a \"localization function\" C(p), whose small-momentum behavior determines the LT in the thermodynamic limit. This clarifies why the LT is sensitive to transitions out of the extended phase but by itself cannot distinguish Anderson-type localization from dimerization: both share the same low-momentum asymptotics. We show that the finite-momentum behavior of C(p), together with an inverse participation ratio (IPR)-based upper bound valid in localized phases, provides a sharp criterion that discriminates localization from dimerization. These results are illustrated on the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Aubry-Andre models, with and without interactions, and suggest that structure factor-based probes offer robust and experimentally accessible diagnostics of localized and dimerized phases under PBC."}

In the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) offers a promising hybrid approach. However, standard QAOA implementations utilizing transverse field mixers often fail to strictly enforce hard constraints, necessitating soft penalties that distort the energy landscape. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of a constraint-preserving QAOA formulation against Simulated Annealing (SA) and Hierarchical Risk Parity (HRP). We implement a specific QAOA ansatz utilizing a Dicke state initialization and an XY-mixer Hamiltonian that strictly preserves the Hamming weight of the solution, ensuring only valid portfolios of size K are explored. Furthermore, we introduce a Trotterized parameter initialization schedule inspired by adiabatic quantum computing to mitigate the \"Barren Plateau\" problem. Backtesting on a basket of 10 US equities over 2025 reveals that our QAOA approach achieves a Sharpe Ratio of 1.81, significantly outperforming Simulated Annealing (1.31) and HRP (0.98). We further analyze the operational implications of the algorithm's high turnover (76.8%), discussing the trade-offs between theoretical optimality and implementation costs in institutional settings."}

Each node consists of an optically interfaced electron spin acting as a data qubit and a long-lived nuclear-spin register acting as a control program. We formalize two modes of programmability: (i) deterministic register control, where the nuclear register is initialized in a basis state to select a specific operation on the data qubit; and (ii) coherent register control, where the register is prepared in superposition, enabling coherent combinations of operations beyond classical programmability. Network protocols are expressed as controller-issued instruction vectors, which we illustrate through a compact realization of the BBPSSW purification protocol.

To address this, circuit depth can be reduced at the cost of more measurements with a Taylor series expansion of UCC factors with small angles, while treating the large-angle factors exactly. We implement this approach to quadratic order (qUCC) for systems with strong correlations and systems where conventional methods like coupled cluster (CC) with low excitation levels fail, but UCC and qUCC perform well. We study hydrogen chains and the BeH2 molecule that allow us to change the degree of strong correlation due to geometrical distortions. We show, via a dramatic increase in number of factors able to handle exactly, a systematic convergence of these results as more exact UCC factors are included in the calculations -- the hardest to converge regime is in the crossover from weak to strong coupling. In all cases the total number of UCC factors needed to be treated exactly is much less than the total number of UCC factors available (typically about one-third to one-half of the total number of factors)."}
