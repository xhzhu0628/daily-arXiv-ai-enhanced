Among the\nmost effective simulation techniques are those based on the stabilizer extent,\nwhich quantifies the overhead of representing non-Clifford operations as linear\ncombinations of Clifford unitaries. However, finding optimal decompositions\nrapidly becomes intractable as it constitutes a superexponentially large\noptimization problem. In this work, we exploit symmetries in the computation of\nthe stabilizer extent, proving that for real, diagonal, and real-diagonal\nunitaries, the optimization can be restricted to the corresponding subgroups of\nthe Clifford group without loss of optimality. This ``strong symmetry\nreduction'' drastically reduces computational cost, enabling optimal\ndecompositions of unitaries on up to seven qubits using a standard laptop--far\nbeyond previous two-qubit limits. Additionally, we employ a ``weak symmetry\nreduction'' method that leverages additional invariances to shrink the search\nspace further. Applying these results, we demonstrate exponential runtime\nimprovements in classical simulations of quantum Fourier transform circuits and\nmeasurement-based quantum computations on the Union Jack lattice, as well as\nnew insights into the non-stabilizer properties of multi-controlled-phase gates\nand unitaries generating hypergraph states.

We investigate the dependence of the engine efficiency on the\norbital angular momentum. Beyond ideality, we discuss finite-time scenarios\nbased on shortcuts to adiabaticity such that the efficiency retains its\nideal-operation value, despite finite-time challenges. Finally, for lower\nvalues of the orbital angular momentum, we describe an alternate scheme for\noperating quantum heat engines based on the adiabatic elimination of a\nmechanical mode. Our analysis identifies orbital angular momentum as an\nexperimentally-accessible control knob that can reconfigure the performance of\nsuch quantum heat engines as desired."}

In this paper, we employ the formalism of quantum walks to\ninvestigate how the topology of the battery and the chirality of the\nHamiltonian influence its performance as an energy storage unit. We analyze\narchitectures of battery cells based on ring, complete, and wheel graph\nstructures and analyze their behavior in the presence of noise. Our results\nshow that these structures exhibit distinct ergotropy scaling, with the\ninterplay between chirality and topology providing a tunable mechanism to\noptimize work extraction and enhance robustness against decoherence. In\nparticular, chirality enhances ergotropy for complete quantum cells, without\naltering the linear scaling with size, whereas in ring cells, it bridges the\nperformance gap between configurations with odd and even number of units.\nAdditionaly, chirality may be exploited to force degeneracies in the\nHamiltonian, a condition that can spare the ergotropy to vanish in the presence\nof pure dephasing. We conclude that topology and chirality are key resources\nfor improving ergotropy, offering guidelines to optimize quantum energy devices\nand protocols."}
