We discuss two complementary\nclassification schemes based on the Altland-Zirnbauer tenfold way: (1) the\nmany-body evolution operator (mEO) symmetry class, which classifies fermionic\ndynamics at the many-body level and generalizes to interacting dynamics, and\n(2) the single-particle transfer matrix (sTM) symmetry class, which classifies\nfree-fermion dynamics at the single-particle level and connects to Anderson\nlocalization physics. In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in\none-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of\narea-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical\nbulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime\n\\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state\nensemble living on its temporal \\textit{boundary}. Building on this\ncorrespondence, we provide a general realization of topological dynamical\nphases using Gaussian adaptive circuits.

Nevertheless, external frame information is treated as gauge in all\nthree formalisms, manifested in constraints on states and algebra.
