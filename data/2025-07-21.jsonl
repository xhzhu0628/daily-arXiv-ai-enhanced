In the free-fermion limit, these two frameworks are in\none-to-one correspondence and yield equivalent topological classifications of\narea-law entangled dynamical phases. This leads to a novel dynamical\nbulk-boundary correspondence: the topology of the dynamical system's spacetime\n\\textit{bulk} determines the topology of the area-law entangled steady-state\nensemble living on its temporal \\textit{boundary}.
