Already, the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is the cornerstone of many quantum algorithms, but the Laplace transform or its discrete version has not seen any efficient implementation on quantum computers due to its dissipative nature and hence non-unitary dynamics. However, a recent work has shown an efficient implementation for certain cases on quantum computers using the Taylor series. Unlike previous work, our work provides a completely different algorithm for doing Laplace Transform using Quantum Eigenvalue Transformation and Lap-LCHS, very efficiently at points which form an arithmetic progression. Our algorithm can implement $N \\times N$ discrete Laplace transform in gate complexity that grows as $O((log\\,N)^3)$, ignoring the state preparation cost, where $N=2^n$ and $n$ is the number of qubits, which is a superpolynomial speedup in number of gates over the best classical counterpart that has complexity $O(N\\cdot log\\,N)$ for the same cases. Also, the circuit width grows as $O(log\\,N)$. Quantum Laplace Transform (QLT) may enable new Quantum algorithms for cases like solving differential equations in the Laplace domain, developing an inverse Laplace transform algorithm on quantum computers, imaginary time evolution in the resolvent domain for calculating ground state energy, and spectral estimation of non-Hermitian matrices."}

We reinterpret this experiment by viewing it through the lens of quantum theory as a generalisation of classical probability, rooted in a Bayesian subjectivist framework. In this revised approach, we treat the experiment as a remote measurement problem. Specifically, we explore how the beliefs of two agents, Alice and Bob, who are spatially separated yet share a quantum state, are updated when local measurements are conducted on their respective systems. Through this reinterpretation of the well-known experiment, we also aim to offer an educational perspective that will be beneficial for young scientists interested in the field of quantum theory."}

A central open question has been how to implement logical operations on these codes. In this work, we show how two techniques from static quantum error-correcting codes can also be implemented on Floquet codes. First, we present a way of implementing fold-transversal operations on Floquet codes in order to yield logical Hadamard and S gates. And second, we present a way of implementing logical CNOT gates on Floquet codes via Dehn twists. We discuss the requirements for these techniques, and show that they are applicable to a wide family of Floquet codes defined on colour code lattices. Through numerical benchmarking of the logical operations on the CCS Floquet code, we establish a logical-gate threshold of 0.25-0.35% and verify sub-threshold exponential error suppression. Our results show that these logical operations are robust, featuring a performance that is close to the baseline set by a quantum memory benchmark. Finally, we explain in detail how to implement logical gates on Floquet codes by operating on the embedded codes."}

On its face, it repudiates many of the key features of the mechanical conception of physical reality. However, the challenge of developing a precise, coherent alternative to that conception has yet to be met. Here, I argue that a major hindrance to the project of quantum interpretation is its existing interpretative methodologies, which suffer from a lack of systematicity in their judgements about what aspects of the theory are interpretational relevant. In particular, I argue that current interpretations tend to marginalize the informal part of the theory in favour of its formal part, and place inappropriate emphasis on the natural language component of the formalism over its detailed mathematical structure. To counterbalance these biases, I propose that an interpretation-free zone be constructed around the theory, wherein an interpreter initially adopt a descriptive stance which considers all parts of the theory, and that the results of this deliberation~(and the judgements about what facts are interpretationally relevant) are reported as part of their interpretation.\n  I argue that the interpretation of quantum theory poses special challenges and difficulties which necessitate this interpretation-free zone, and that existing interpretative methodologies are insufficient to address them. Further, I argue that a reconstructive interpretative methodology, which harnesses the recent results of the quantum reconstruction program, provides a powerful means to identify almost all facts that could be interpretationally relevant, and naturally meets these challenges and difficulties. Moreover, I argue that the quantum reconstruction program offers a powerful way to discover new physical principles, and offers a systematic pathway to build a rich, coherent conception of quantum reality."}

During a single cooldown and over a period of 95 hours, we monitored several parameters for 8 qubits, including coherence times $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, which exhibit fluctuations originating primarily from the interaction between two-level system (TLS) defects and the host qubit. We also demonstrate that subtractively-fabricated superconducting quantum devices align with the theoretical predictions that higher mean lifetimes $T_1$ correspond to larger fluctuations. To assess long-term stability, we tracked two representative qubits over 10 cooldown cycles spanning more than one year. We observed an average total downward shift in both qubit transition frequencies of approximately 61 MHz within the thermal cycles considered. In contrast, readout resonator frequencies decreased only marginally. Meanwhile, $T_1$ exhibits fluctuations from cycle to cycle, but maintains a stable baseline value."}

The time mean of the overlap function decays inversely with the effective Hilbert space occupied by the initial state for the non-periodic case. Two different stationary regimes were found for the overlap mean and overlap variance. The state non-classicality was investigated using the roughness measure, and its mean also has two stationary regimes. For large effective Hilbert space, the roughness time mean depends more on the effective space than the initial state. While the Wigner function is dominated by the non-diagonal terms, the overlap operator has some contribution on each part, but it is more affected by the diagonal terms than the density matrix."}

Traditional methods often fall short, relying on static and largely qualitative models that do not scale with system complexity and fail to capture systemic interdependencies. In this work, we introduce a novel quantitative approach to cyber risk assessment based on Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO), a formulation compatible with both classical computing and quantum annealing. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a realistic 255-nodes layered infrastructure, showing how risk spreads in non-trivial patterns that are difficult to identify through visual inspection alone. To assess scalability, we further conduct extensive experiments on networks up to 1000 nodes comparing classical, quantum, and hybrid classical-quantum workflows. Our results reveal that although quantum annealing produces solutions comparable to classical heuristics, its potential advantages are significantly hindered by the embedding overhead required to map the densely connected cyber-risk QUBO onto the limited connectivity of current quantum hardware. By contrast, hybrid quantum-classical solvers avoid this bottleneck and therefore emerge as a promising option, combining competitive scaling with an improved ability to explore the solution space and identify more stable risk configurations. Overall, this work delivers two main advances.

A key prerequisite for scalable quantum chemistry, however, is size consistency: the energy of non-interacting subsystems must scale linearly with system size. While many algorithms are theoretically size-consistent, noise on quantum devices may couple nominally independent subsystems and degrade this fundamental property. Here, we systematically evaluate size consistency on quantum hardware by simulating systems composed of increasing numbers of non-interacting H$_{2}$ molecules using optimally shallow unitary circuits. We find that molecular energies remain size-consistent within chemical accuracy for an estimated 118 and 71 H$_{2}$ subsystems for one- and two-qubit unitary designs, respectively, demonstrating that current quantum devices preserve size consistency over chemically relevant system sizes and supporting the feasibility of scalable, noise-resilient simulation of strongly correlated molecules and materials."}

The proposed method constructs a qubit-efficient image representation by first applying a cartographic generalization algorithm to a classical edge-extracted input image, yielding a highly optimized sparse-dot based geometric description. While ensuring the structural integrity of the image, this sparse representation is then embedded into the atomic configuration of Aquila (QuEra Computing Inc.), modeled through the Bloqade simulation software stack. By encoding visual information through physical atom placement rather than digital basis-state coding, the approach avoids the costly state-preparation overhead inherent to digital quantum image processing circuits. Additionally, pruning sparse dot images, akin to map feature reduction, compresses representations without fidelity loss, thereby substantially reducing qubit requirements when implemented on an analog neutral-atom quantum device. The resulting quantum-native images have been successfully evaluated through matching tasks against an image database, thus illustrating the feasibility of this approach for image matching applications. Since sparse-dot image representations enable seamless generation of synthetic datasets, this work constitutes an initial step towards fully quantum-native machine-learning pipelines for visual data and highlights the potential of scalable analog quantum computing to enable resource-efficient alternatives to energy-intensive classical AI-based image processing frameworks."}

However, problems of practical relevance typically have more variables than current or foreseeable quantum computers have qubits. Here we introduce a divide and conquer approach that partitions the optimization problem into subgraphs that can be represented on smaller quantum processors. We then find all states of the subgraphs that can possibly be part of the solution to the entire problem by determining the cost or energy ranges in which the local subgraph energies of these states must be contained. This allows us to reduce the problem by only considering the subspace spanned by these states. We then recombine the system using a binary encoding for each subgraph with a local energy ordering. This process can be iterated until no further reduction is possible. We also find that the number of necessary qubits can be reduced further when only retaining states in a fraction of the relevant energy range at very little expense in terms of approximation ratio to the global ground state. In numerical simulations, we find that our approach allows us to solve combinatorial optimization problems on weighted random 3-regular graphs with $|\\mathcal{V}|=40$ discrete variables on $\\sim |\\mathcal{V}| / 4$ qubits while retaining a possible approximation ratio of $\\sim99.9\\%$.

We develop an ansatz which allows to quantize the resonator's resonances with position-resolved discrete modes, thus naturally incorporating losses in the formalism.

Small, near-term quantum processors are now available, but existing work rarely shows whether quantum components can improve end-to-end detection under these unstable, resource constrained conditions rather than just adding complexity. We address this gap with a hybrid architecture that uses a compact multilayer perceptron to compress security data and then routes a few features to 2-4 qubit quantum heads implemented as quantum support vector machines and variational circuits. Under matched preprocessing and training budgets, we benchmark these hybrids against tuned classical baselines on two security tasks, network intrusion detection on NSL-KDD and spam filtering on Ling-Spam datasets, and then deploy the best 4-qubit quantum SVM to an IBM Quantum device with noise-aware execution (readout mitigation and dynamical decoupling). Across both datasets, shallow quantum heads consistently match, and on difficult near-boundary cases modestly reduce, missed attacks and false alarms relative to classical models using the same features. Hardware results track simulator behavior closely enough that the remaining gap is dominated by device noise rather than model design. Taken together, the study shows that even on small, noisy chips, carefully engineered quantum components can already function as competitive, budget-aware elements in practical threat detection pipelines."}

Here, we derive three results strengthening the state-of-art. Firstly, we show that states of constant local dimension $d$ are already sufficient to certify quantum nonlocality under arbitrary MI and PI relaxation, albeit in a non-robust manner. Secondly, and as a theoretical paradigm to derive the above, we introduce the notion of \\textit{measurement-dependent parameter-dependent locality} as the set of input-output behaviors under simultaneous relaxations of measurement and parameter independence. We provide a rigorous characterisation of the vertices of the polytope of joint input-output behaviors that obey a $μ$-relaxation of MI and $ε$-relaxation of PI. We highlight a relation between nonlocality certification under PI relaxation and that under detection inefficiencies by pointing out alternative extremal correlations to the Eberhard correlations that also allow to achieve detection efficiency of $η= 2/3$ in the two-input scenario. Finally, we study the implication of the relaxed assumptions for device-independent randomness certification.

Interestingly in an MDQN, the inseparability of two subsystems underlying entanglement can occur both between multiple distinct photons as well as between individual degrees of freedom associated with a single photon. In this work, we investigate the entanglement transfer enabled by the interplay of both entanglement between two distinct photons as well as inseparability between multiple degrees of freedom.

For any finite-query protocol -- including arbitrary accessible ancillas, intermediate measurements, adaptivity, and general CPTP processing between queries -- the induced output state on the accessible registers depends on the memory state only through its diagonal in the truth-table basis.

To prepare the input, images are first compressed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), reducing their dimensionality to match the size of the atom array. Each feature vector is encoded into local detuning parameters of a time-dependent Hamiltonian governing the Rydberg system. As the system evolves, it generates nonlinear embeddings through the measurement of observables across multiple time steps. These temporal embeddings capture complex correlations, which are fed into a classical neural network to reconstruct the denoised images. To evaluate performance, we compare this QRC-assisted model against a baseline architecture consisting of PCA followed by a dense neural network, trained under identical conditions.

Experiments performed on QuEra's Aquila quantum processor are benchmarked against large-scale coherent emulations using the Juelich Quantum Annealing Simulator (JUQAS), enabling the controlled inclusion of realistic hardware imperfections. In the ideal coherent limit, a tunable longitudinal field induces confinement of domain-wall excitations into mesonic bound states, leading to a progressive truncation of the correlation light cone. When experimentally relevant inhomogeneities and fluctuations are included, correlations instead saturate at finite distance even in the nominally deconfined regime, revealing localization driven by emergent disorder. The close quantitative agreement between noisy emulations and experimental data allows us to attribute the observed saturation to specific hardware error channels and to identify the dominant contribution. Our results establish a practical framework for diagnosing and modeling error-induced localization in Rydberg quantum processors, while demonstrating that confinement remains a robust and programmable mechanism for engineering non-ergodic dynamics on near-term quantum hardware."}

However, existing all-optical quantum communication protocols either require complicated quantum error correction steps for logical-qubit recoveries at every few kilometers or, over larger quantum repeater segments, they would at least depend on sharing complex multi-photon entangled states. Here we propose an all-optical memory-based quantum repeater for long-distance quantum communication, with quantum memories at each repeater station realized in the form of fiber loops combined with suitable quantum error correction codes for photon-loss protection. By sending only single-photon states through the fibers connecting the stations, such repeaters can operate in the classical infrastructure's long-segment regime. We analyze the performance of our scheme for the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill code, including a concatenation with the Steane code, as well as the single-photon quantum parity code for total distances up to 10000 km."}

Here we show that chaos enables switchable eigenstate resources: avoided crossings in soft- versus strong- chaos windows selectively realize an entanglement-peak mode or a coherence-peak mode within the same system. Crucially, this chaos-controlled inversion is not tied to a particular notion of subsystems, appearing both in single-wave settings and in genuine many-body settings. From the quantum-chaos perspective, conventional diagnostics based on avoided-crossing phenomenology and eigenmode delocalization are insufficient; eigenfunction entanglement and basis coherence provide the missing discriminants. Using two wave-chaotic billiards and a tilted-field Ising chain, we track the information-theoretic response of eigenstates across localized hybridization windows. Even when avoided-crossing phenomenology and delocalization are comparable, the entanglement and coherence responses invert between soft- and strong-chaos regimes. In the Ising chain, a single microscopic knob, the global field tilt, toggles between the two operating modes and reveals a trade-off in which off-diagonal correlations grow as diagonal populations dip. Our diagnostics require only reduced states (or their spectra) and are compatible with mode imaging in wave-chaos resonators and randomized measurements in programmable spin simulators."}

We extend this universal concept to non-Hermitian systems by defining topological chirality, an invariant that emerges whenever an exceptional-points (EP) pair is present. Built from the non-commutative fundamental group and its braid representation, topological chirality acts as a singularity selector: clockwise EP loops occupy a homotopy class that avoids EPs, whereas counter-clockwise mirrors are equivalent only if they cross the EPs themselves. We confirm this binary rule in an optical microcavity and a non-Hermitian topological band. The same two-sheeted topology governs EP pairs in spin systems, photonic crystals and hybrid light-matter structures, where EP encirclements have already been demonstrated, so the framework transfers without alteration and confirms its experimental viability. Our findings lay the cornerstone for interpreting loop-sensitive observables such as spectral vorticity, the complex Berry phase and the non-Abelian holonomy.

In the event of communication interruption due to external disturbances, the SLIS seamlessly switches to perception system, employing interference measurement and WM techniques to monitor channel disturbances. By integrating null-frequencies localization (NFL) mode, the system precisely determines the disturbance location, enabling rapid identification of security vulnerabilities along the link. Experimental results demonstrate that, over a 30 km Sagnac loop channel, the SLIS achieves a raw key generation rate of 22.4 kbps with stable operation and clear scalability toward network expansion. In terms of perception performance, the SLIS exhibits strong capability for both dynamic and quasi-static disturbances. For dynamic perturbations, the system detects transient impacts and PZT-driven frequency variations down to 100 Hz, and enables long-distance localization via NFL alignment, with improved localization performance as the disturbance position moves farther away along the loop. For quasi-static disturbances, gravitational changes as small as 100 g are resolved, corresponding to a time-delay variation of 9.81 as.

To this end we employ a rigorous formalism of probability measures on spacetime and quantify the probability of a successful superluminal bit transfer via the single-particle Schrödinger-Newton equation. We demonstrate that such a quantity decreases with the increasing size and mass of the system. Furthermore, we prove that the Einstein-Dirac system, which yields the Schrödinger-Newton equation in the non-relativistic limit, is perfectly compatible with the relativistic causal structure.

The model is designed to support both baseline planning and disruption management under increased passenger demand. Using a graph-hypergraph representation of trips and single or coupled EMU movements, we first solve the problem with a classical ILP solver.

This tension has long obstructed the formulation of a relativistic master equation: standard Markovian approximations either break Lorentz covariance, trigger catastrophic vacuum heating, or depend arbitrarily on the observer's foliation. In this work, we derive a Lorentz-invariant description of irreversibility for quantum fields. We take an approach that explicitly models the measurements required to observe irreversible dynamics. Instead of evolving the system along an abstract geometric time parameter, we anchor the dynamics to a physical, relational scalar clock field. Using a relational Tomonaga-Schwinger framework, we derive a local, non-Markovian master equation that is manifestly covariant and completely positive. We show that the finite resolution of the physical clock acts as a covariant regulator, preventing the vacuum instability that plagues white-noise models. This framework demonstrates that a consistent relativistic theory of decay exists, provided the reference frame is treated as a dynamical quantum resource rather than a gauge choice. In a gravitating context, the resulting dynamics is described by a hybrid classical-quantum (CQ) evolution that remains completely positive and trace preserving (CPTP)."}

However, both require repeated quantum circuit executions for each Krylov subspace and for every new Hamiltonian, posing a major bottleneck under noisy hardware constraints. We introduce Generative Krylov Subspace Representations (GenKSR), a framework that learns a classical generative representation of the entire Krylov diagonalization process. To enable effective modeling of quantum systems, GenKSR leverages a conditional generative model framework. We investigate two representative backbone architectures, the standard Transformer and the Mamba state-space model. By learning the distribution of measurement outcomes conditioned on Hamiltonian parameters and evolution time, GenKSR generates Krylov subspace samples for unseen Hamiltonians and for larger subspace dimensions than those used in training. This enables full energy reconstruction purely from the classical model, without additional quantum experiments. We validate our approach through simulations of 15-qubit 1D and 16-qubit 2D Heisenberg models, as well as a hardware experiment on a 20-qubit XXZ chain executed on an IBM quantum processor. Our model successfully learns the distribution from experimental data and generates a high-fidelity representation of the quantum process.

However, it typically incurs a measurement overhead exponential in the number of cut locations, and it remains open whether this scaling is fundamentally unavoidable. In conventional circuit-cutting approaches based on the quasiprobability decomposition (QPD), for example, rescaling factors lead to an exponential dependence on the number of cuts. In this work, we show that such an exponential scaling is not universal: it can be circumvented for tree-structured quantum circuits via concatenated quantum tomography protocols. We first consider estimating the expectation value of an observable within additive error $ε$ for a tree-structured circuit with tree depth 1 (two layers), maximum branching factor $R$, and bond dimension at most $d$ on each edge. Our approach uses quantum tomography to construct, for each cut edge, a local decomposition that eliminates the rescaling factors in conventional QPD, instead introducing a controllable bias set by the tomography sample size. After cutting $R$ edges, we show that $\\mathcal{O}(d^3R^3\\ln(dR)/ε^2)$ total measurements suffice, including tomography cost. Next, we extend the tree-depth-1 case to general trees of depth $L\\geq2$, and give an algorithm whose total measurement cost $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^3K^{5}/ε^2)$ scales polynomially with the number of cuts for complete $R$-ary trees. Finally, we perform an information-theoretic analysis to show that, in a comparable tree-depth-1 setting, conventional QPD-based wire-cutting methods require at least $Ω((d+1)^R/ε^2)$ measurements. This exponential separation highlights the significance of tomography-based construction for reducing measurement overhead in hybrid quantum-classical computations."}

In particular, recent works have generalized this concept to microscopy setups, but the sensitivity to optical path differences constrains its application to samples with thickness variation typically below a few micrometers if tracking changes in the coincidences at a fixed delay. Extending the concept to polarization microscopy and circumventing this limitation, this manuscript explores the use of a narrowband photon pair source with coherence length >1 mm to broaden the HOM dip. Thus, realistic sample-thickness variations introduce negligible temporal distinguishability, and changes in coincidence rate at the dip centre are then dominated by sample-induced polarization effects. To compute the polarization rotation, we develop a statistical model for the interferometer, derive the Fisher information, and establish a maximum-likelihood estimator for the local fast-axis angle. Recording dip and baseline frames at each sample position via raster scanning, the experimental results validate the framework, agreeing with classical polarized-intensity images while demonstrating operation at a maximum-precision regime and insensitiveness to layer thickness.

Their non-stabilizerness provides the additional resource required to overcome the constraints of stabilizer codes, as formalized by the Eastin-Knill theorem, while still permitting fault-tolerant distillation. Although numerous measures of magic have been introduced, not every state with nonzero magic has been shown to be distillable by a stabilizer code, and all currently known distillable states arise as special cases of Clifford-stabilizer states, defined as pure states uniquely stabilized by finite subgroups of the Clifford group. In this work, we develop a general framework for group-covariant functionals on the real manifold of Hermitian operators. We formalize the notions of $G$-stabilizer spaces, states, and codes for arbitrary finite subgroups $G \\subset \\mathrm{U}(\\mathcal{H})$, and introduce analytic families of $G$-covariant functionals. Our main theorem shows that any $G$-invariant pure state is an extremal point of a broad class of derived functionals, including symmetric, max-type, and Rényi-type functionals, provided the underlying family is $G$-covariant. This extremality holds for variations restricted to directions orthogonal to the stabilized subspace while preserving purity. Specializing to the Pauli and Clifford groups, our framework unifies the extremality structure of several canonical magic measures, including mana, stabilizer Rényi entropies, and stabilizer fidelity. In particular, Clifford-stabilizer states extremize these measures. We classify such states for qubits, qutrits, ququints, and two-qubit systems, identifying new candidates for magic distillation protocols. We further propose an inefficient distillation protocol for a two-qubit magic state with stabilizer fidelity exceeding that of standard benchmark states."}

Achieving fair, scalable and consistent evaluations is a key open problem in quantum computing, particularly in the pre-fault-tolerant era. To address this challenge, we introduce QuSquare, a quality-oriented benchmark suite designed to provide a scalable, fair, reproducible, and well-defined framework for assessing the performance of quantum devices across hardware architectures. QuSquare consists of four benchmark tests that evaluate quantum hardware performance at both the system and application levels: Partial Clifford Randomized, Multipartite Entanglement, Transverse Field Ising Model (TFIM) Hamiltonian Simulation, and Data Re-Uploading Quantum Neural Network (QNN). Together, these benchmarks offer an integral, hardware-agnostic, and impartial methodology to quantify the quality and capabilities of current quantum computers, supporting fair cross-platform comparisons and fostering the development of future performance standards."}

We propose the use of two distinct quantum annealer sampling methods: chains of Monte Carlo-like reverse quantum anneals, and standard linear-ramp quantum annealing. The control parameters used to attenuate the quality of the simulations are the effective analog energy scale of the J coupling, the total annealing time, and for the case of reverse annealing the anneal-pause. The core estimation technique is to sample across the energy spectrum of the classical Hamiltonian of interest, and therefore obtain a density of states estimate for each energy level, which in turn can be used to compute an estimate of the partition function with some sampling error. This estimation technique is powerful because once the distribution is sampled it allows thermodynamic quantity computation at arbitrary temperatures. On a $25$ spin $\\pm J$ hardware graph native Ising model we find parameter regimes of the D-Wave processors that provide comparable result quality to two standard classical Monte Carlo methods, Multiple Histogram Reweighting and Wang-Landau. Remarkably, we find that fast quench-like anneals can quickly generate ensemble distributions that are very good estimates of the true partition function of the classical Ising model; on a Pegasus graph-structured QPU we report a logarithmic relative error of $7.6 \\times 10^{-6}$, from $171,000$ samples generated using $0.2$ seconds of QPU time with an anneal time of $8$ nanoseconds per sample which is interestingly within the closed system dynamics timescale of the superconducting qubits."}
