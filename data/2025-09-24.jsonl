We demonstrate that these\nissues are artifacts of defining the code on an unbounded phase-space. By\nconsidering the compact quantum-phase-space intrinsic to systems like coupled\nquantum harmonic oscillators, we have obtained a Generalized GKP (GGKP) state\nthat is both exact and physically realizable. This is achieved by applying an\nobtained Quantum Zak Transform (QZT) to Squeezed Coherent States, which reveals\nthat Riemann-Theta functions are the natural representation of these states on\nthe quantum torus phase-space. This framework not only provides a well-behaved\nquantum state, but also reveals a deep connection between quantum error correc-\ntion, non-commutative geometry, and the theory of generalized Theta functions.\nThis opens a new avenue for fault-tolerant photonic quantum computing."}

We found a persistent bias towards trivial\nmapping, which can be addressed through increased optimization provided that\nthe overall utilization of an architecture remains below a certain threshold.\nAs a result, some qubits are overused whereas other remain underused. The\nimplication of our study are many-fold namely, (a) potential reduction in\ncalibration overhead by focusing on overused qubits, (b) refining optimization,\nmapping and routing algorithms to maximize the hardware utilization and (c)\npricing underused qubits at low rate to motivate their usage and improve\nhardware throughput (applicable in multi-tenant environments)."}

In\narXiv:2110.14691, a uniqueness theorem was stated: the only possible tuple of\n(code, bipartition, algebra) which can exhibit complementary recovery is the\nmaximal one $\\mathcal{M}=P(\\mathcal{L}(\\mathcal{H}_A)\\otimes\nI_{\\mathcal{H}_{\\bar A}})P$. We point out a counterexample to this result,\nusing a ``non-adjacent'' bipartition of a four-qubit code proposed in\narXiv:2110.14691. We show that the failure of uniqueness is due to a failure to\nenforce error correction against erasure of $\\mathcal{H}_{\\bar A}$, which\nrequires enforcing the algebraic Knill-Laflamme condition $[P E_i^\\dagger E_j\nP,\\mathcal{M}]=0$ for each pair of error operators. When we add the additional\nrequirement that $\\mathcal{M}$ be correctable with respect to this channel,\nuniqueness is restored, and we re-prove the theorem of arXiv:2110.14691 with\nthis added assumption. We present the list of bipartitions of the ``atomic''\nholographic codes in arXiv:2110.14691 in which the correctability assumption\ncan be violated."}
