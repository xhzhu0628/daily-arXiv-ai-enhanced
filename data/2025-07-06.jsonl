The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its\nclassical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly\nenhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we\ninvestigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the\nlossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration\nwe show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the\ncavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states\nand its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the\ntransmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the\nqubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the\nproposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather\nthan the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The\nphysical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is\ndemonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum\nelectrodynamical devices."}

A\ncode that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the\nfault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called \"single-shot\" error\ncorrection, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single\nround of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we\ncombine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.\n  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product\ncode and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps\nthe single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold\nwhenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.\n  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed\nvariants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count\nby $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum\ndistance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased\nnoise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the\nsame hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or\npurely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or\ndepolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either\ntrimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full\nconstruction.\n  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to\na three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an\nexplicit member of the simplified family.\n  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable\nset of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead\nand noise types."}
