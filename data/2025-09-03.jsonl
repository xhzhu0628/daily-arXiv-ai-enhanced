In our paper, we find\nthat as the dilaton parameter increases, the fidelity of quantum teleportation\ncan either decrease or increase, which suggests that even in the presence of\nsystem-environment coupling, the dilaton effect of black hole can positive\ninfluence teleportation fidelity; specifically, the dilaton effect can create\nnet fidelity in quantum teleportation under decoherence. This interesting\nresult challenges the long-held belief that the effects of black holes and\nenvironmental decoherence can only reduce the fidelity of quantum\nteleportation. Additionally, we observe an unreported result: if the fidelity\nof quantum teleportation remains in the classical region, it can be transformed\ninto the quantum region by utilizing a local filtering operation, thereby\nachieving better fidelity than classical communication. This impressive result\nmay provide new insights for developing an experimental scheme to effectively\nimplement quantum teleportation in the context of dilaton black holes under\ndecoherence."}

Under a smoothness assumption on the\nsystem-environment interaction, we develop near-optimal algorithms that, for a\nmodel with $N$ spins and evolution time $t$, attain a simulation error $\\delta$\nin the system-state with $\\mathcal{O}(Nt(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ gates,\n$\\mathcal{O}(t(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ parallelized circuit depth and\n$\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(N(Nt/\\delta)^{1 + o(1)})$ ancillas. We additionally show\nthat, if only simulating local observables is of interest, then the circuit\ndepth of the digital algorithm can be chosen to be independent of the system\nsize $N$. This provides theoretical evidence for the utility of these\nalgorithms for simulating physically relevant models, where typically local\nobservables are of interest, on pre-fault tolerant devices. Finally, for the\nlimiting case of Markovian dynamics with commuting jump operators, we propose\ntwo algorithms based on sampling a Wiener process and on a locally dilated\nHamiltonian construction, respectively. These algorithms reduce the asymptotic\ngate complexity on $N$ compared to currently available algorithms in terms of\nthe required number of geometrically local gates."}

We introduce a scalable Floquet-informed learning algorithm\nthat represents the Hamiltonian as a truncated Fourier series and recasts\nparameter estimation as a compact linear inverse problem in the Floquet band\npicture. The algorithm is well-suited to problems satisfying mild\nsmoothness/band-limiting. In this regime, its sample and runtime complexities\nscale polynomially with the Fourier cutoff, time resolution, and the number of\nunknown coefficients. For local Hamiltonian models, the coefficients grows\npolynomially with system size, yielding at most polylogarithmic dependence on\nthe Hilbert-space dimension. Furthermore, numerical experiments on one- and\ntwo-dimensional Ising and Heisenberg lattices show fast convergence to time\nresolution and robustness to higher-order perturbations.

The approach is validated through a hardware demonstration utilising\n42 qubits of an IQM superconducting device to calculate the potential energy\ncurve of the inorganic silane molecule, SiH4 using a 6-31G atomic orbital basis\nset, under a stretching of the Si-H bond length.
