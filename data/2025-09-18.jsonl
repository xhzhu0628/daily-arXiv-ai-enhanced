While classical methods are limited by\nscaling and quantum algorithms by hardware, this thesis focuses on the\nState-Averaged Orbital-Optimized Variational Quantum Eigensolver (SA-OO-VQE).\nThis hybrid quantum-classical algorithm provides a balanced description of\nmultiple electronic states by combining quantum state preparation with\nclassical state-averaged orbital optimization.\n  A key contribution is the implementation and evaluation of the Differential\nEvolution algorithm within the SA-OO-VQE framework, with a comparative study\nagainst classical optimizers like the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS)\nand Sequential Least Squares Programming (SLSQP) algorithms. The performance of\nthese optimizers is assessed by calculating ground and first excited state\nenergies for H$_2$, H$_4$, and LiH.\n  The thesis also demonstrates SA-OO-VQE's capability to accurately model\npotential energy surfaces near conical intersections, using formaldimine as a\ncase study. The results show that orbital optimization is essential for\ncorrectly capturing the potential energy surface topology, a task where\nstandard methods with fixed orbitals fail. Our findings indicate that while\nDifferential Evolution presents efficiency challenges, gradient-based methods\nlike BFGS and SLSQP offer superior performance, confirming that the SA-OO-VQE\napproach is crucial for treating complex electronic structures."}

This second result\nprovides a precise information-theoretic interpretation for the higher-point\nOTOCs as collectively quantifying operator ergodicity and the approach to\nfreeness. This physical interpretation is particularly useful in light of\nrecent progress in experimentally measuring higher-point OTOCs. We identify\nuniversal behaviours of the FMI and higher-point OTOCs across a variety of\nchaotic systems, including random unitary circuits and chaotic spin chains,\nwhich indicate that spreading in the doubly exponential operator space is a\ngeneric feature of quantum many-body chaos. At the same time, the non-generic\nbehavior of the FMI in various non-chaotic systems, including certain unitary\ndesigns, shows that there are cases where an operator spreads in physical space\nbut remains localized in operator space. The FMI is thus a sharper diagnostic\nof chaos than the standard 4-point OTOC."}

Here, we develop\na machine learning approach based on a variational autoencoder (VAE) to analyze\ninterference measurements of tunnel-coupled one-dimensional Bose gases, which\nrealize the sine-Gordon quantum field theory. Trained in an unsupervised\nmanner, the VAE learns a minimal latent representation that strongly correlates\nwith the equilibrium control parameter of the system. Applied to\nnon-equilibrium protocols, the latent space uncovers signatures of frozen-in\nsolitons following rapid cooling, and reveals anomalous post-quench dynamics\nnot captured by conventional correlation-based methods. These results\ndemonstrate that generative models can extract physically interpretable\nvariables directly from noisy and sparse experimental data, providing\ncomplementary probes of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physics in quantum\nsimulators. More broadly, our work highlights how machine learning can\nsupplement established field-theoretical techniques, paving the way for\nscalable, data-driven discovery in quantum many-body systems."}

Mousavi"], "title": "Trajectory-based Measure of Nonlocality in the Double Caldeira-Leggett Formalism", "comment": "Accepted for Publication in Physica Scripta", "summary": "We investigate the dynamics of quantum correlations in bipartite systems\ninitially prepared in a squeezed state, comparing closed-system unitary\nevolution under the Schr\\\"odinger equation with open-system dynamics governed\nby the Caldeira-Leggett master equation in the high-temperature, weak-coupling\nregime, all within the Bohmian mechanics framework. Quantum nonlocality is\nquantified via the sensitivity of the Bohmian velocity of one particle to the\nposition of the other. Our results show that in both distinct (local) and\ncommon bath scenarios, nonlocal correlations initially grow from zero, reach a\npeak, and then decay. In the case of local baths, the decay is smooth and\nmonotonic; although the peak value increases with temperature, its temporal\nwidth (measured via the full width at half maximum) decreases, indicating a\nshorter duration of nonlocal correlations. For a common bath, the initial\ngrowth and decay are followed by revivals and oscillations, whose amplitude and\ntiming vary with temperature. These non-monotonic behaviors arise despite the\nMarkovian nature of the underlying dynamics and reflect the nontrivial role of\nsystem-bath correlations. We also analyze how both temperature and the\nsqueezing decay parameter affect the structure of Bohmian trajectories and the\nevolution of nonlocal correlations. This trajectory-based, velocity-sensitivity\nmeasure offers an intuitive and quantitative understanding of entanglement\ndegradation, decoherence, and their characteristic time scales. Our findings\nemphasize how the structure of the environment critically shapes the observable\ndynamics of quantum correlations, even in Markovian regimes."}
