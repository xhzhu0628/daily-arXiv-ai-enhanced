One of the key steps for proving classical\nhardness of GBS is the so-called ``hiding conjecture'', which asserts that one\ncan ``hide'' a complex Gaussian matrix as a submatrix of the outer product of\nHaar unitary submatrices in total variation distance. In this paper, we prove\nthe hiding conjecture for input states with the maximal number of squeezed\nstates, which is a setup that has recently been realized experimentally [Madsen\net al., Nature 606, 75 (2022)]. In this setting, the hiding conjecture states\nthat a $o(\\sqrt{M})\\times o(\\sqrt{M})$ submatrix of an $M\\times M$ circular\northogonal ensemble (COE) random matrix can be well-approximated by a complex\nGaussian matrix in total variation distance as $M\\to\\infty$. This is the first\nrigorous proof of the hiding property for GBS in the experimentally relevant\nregime, and puts the argument for hardness of classically simulating GBS with a\nmaximal number of squeezed states on a comparable level to that of the\nconventional boson sampling of [Aaronson and Arkhipov, Theory Comput. 9, 143\n(2013)]."}

The Wasserstein generative\nadversarial network (WGAN) algorithm provides a platform to train the machine\nto compare patterns corresponding to input and generated tomograms. Using a\ndeep-learning framework with two convolutional neural networks and WGAN, we\nhave trained the machine to generate tomograms of Fock states, coherent states\n(CS) and the single photon added CS ($1$-PACS). The training process was\ncontinued until the Wasserstein distance between the input and output\ntomographic patterns levelled off at a low value. The mean photon number,\nvariances and higher moments were extracted directly from the generated\ntomograms, to distinguish between different Fock states and also between the CS\nand the $1$-PACS, without using an additional classifier neural network. The\nrobustness of our results has been verified using two error models and also\nwith different colormaps that define the tomographic patterns. We have examined\nif the training program successfully reflected some of the findings in a recent\nexperiment in which state reconstruction was carried out to establish that the\nfidelities between an amplified CS, an optimal CS and a $1$-PACS were close to\nunity, over a range of parameter values. By training the machine to reproduce\ntomograms corresponding to these specific states, and comparing the mean photon\nnumbers of these states obtained directly from the tomograms, we have\nestablished that the variations in these observables reflect the experimental\ntrends. State reconstruction from tomograms could be challenging, in general,\nsince the Hilbert space associated with quantized light is large. The\ntomographic approach provides a viable alternative to detailed state\nreconstruction. Our work demonstrates the use of machine learning to generate\noptical tomograms from which the states can be directly characterized."}

The standard operational formulation, widely used in\nquantum information, imposes a definite, acyclic causal order on agents'\noperations, contrasting with time-symmetric dynamics. Two prominent extensions\nof this framework are the multi-time state (MTS) formalism, which incorporates\ntime symmetry via arbitrary pre- and post-selection, and the post-selected\nclosed timelike curve (P-CTC) framework, which enables cyclic causal influences\nthrough post-selection on maximally entangled states. While prior work has\nnoted structural connections between MTS and P-CTCs, it remained unclear\nwhether an operational equivalence exists, or whether constructive mappings can\nbe established between their most general objects. In this work, we address\nthis gap by extending the P-CTC framework to define time-labelled P-CTC\nassisted combs, a more general class of P-CTC-assisted objects that support\nopen processing slots and explicit temporal structure. We prove that for every\n(possibly mixed) MTS, there exists an operationally equivalent time-labelled\nP-CTC-assisted comb, and vice versa. The equivalence is shown via explicit\nmappings, while discussing the number and dimensionality of the P-CTCs\ninvolved. We also explore a resource-theoretic view of MTS, defining a partial\norder under free transformations that do not use P-CTCs.
