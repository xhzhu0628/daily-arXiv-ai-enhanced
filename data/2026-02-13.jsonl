But a comprehensive theoretical research on both of them remains to be performed. This work aims to investigate important algebraic properties of generalized Bell states as well as explore topological features of quantum teleportation. First, the basis theorem and basis group are introduced to explain that the extension of a generalized Bell basis by a unitary matrix is still an orthonormal basis. Then a twist operator is defined to make a connection between a generalized multiple qubit Bell state and a tensor product of two qubit Bell state. Besides them, the Temperley--Lieb algebra, the braid group relation and the Yang--Baxter equation are used to provide a topological diagrammatic description of generalized Bell states and quantum teleportation. It turns out that our approach is able to present a clear illustration of relevant quantum information protocols and exhibit a topological nature of quantum entanglement and quantum teleportation."}

This, however, inevitably yields an increased configuration variance beyond Born-rule shot noise. We develop a broad framework for accounting for and reducing this variance and prove that stratified sampling -- under ideal proportional allocation -- results in an unbiased estimator with a variance that is never worse than naïve sampling (with equality only in degenerate cases).\n  Furthermore, we provide a classical dynamic programme to enable stratification on arbitrary product-form QPDs. Numerical simulations of typical QPDs, such as Probabilistic Error Cancellation (PEC) and Probabilistic Angle Interpolation (PAI), demonstrate constant-factor reductions in overall variance (up to $\\sim 60$--$80\\%$ in an oracle model) and robust $\\sim 10\\%$ savings in the pessimistic single-shot regime. Our results can be applied immediately to reduce the net sampling cost of practically relevant QPDs that are commonly used in near term and early fault-tolerant algorithms without requiring additional quantum resources."}

Furthermore, he showed the proposal is inherently robust to local perturbations (arXiv:cond-mat/0010440, arxiv:quant-ph/9707021, arXiv:1001.0344, arXiv:1001.4363) when anyons are created as quasiparticle excitations of a topologically ordered lattice model prepared at zero temperature. Over the decades following this proposal there have been considerable technological developments towards the construction of a fault-tolerant quantum computer. Rather than maintaining some target ground state at zero temperature, a modern approach is to actively correct the errors a target state experiences, where we use noisy quantum circuit elements to identify and subsequently correct for deviations from the ideal state. We present an error-correction scheme that enables us to carry out robust universal quantum computation by braiding anyons. We show that our scheme can be carried out on a suitably large device with an arbitrarily small failure rate assuming circuit elements are below some threshold level of local noise. The error-corrected scheme we have developed therefore enables us to carry out fault-tolerant topological quantum computation using modern quantum hardware that is now under development."}

Building on these conditions, we develop an optimal control framework, the utility of which is demonstrated through numerical identification of superresolution control protocols in the presence of realistic, experimentally-relevant constraints. We further extend our results to entangled initial states and assess their potential advantage. Our approach is broadly applicable to a wide variety of quantum sensing platforms, and it provides a systematic path to discover novel protocols that surpass conventional resolution limits in these systems."}

We experimentally support this decade-and-a-half-old prediction by comparing indistinguishable with distinguishable photons. We use a fully programmable linear-optics platform, whose local photon statistics were shown recently to behave thermally. Our demon nondestructively measures the number of photons in a subset of the modes. Guided by the outcome, he conditionally interchanges the measured and unmeasured modes. This interchange creates a positive temperature difference between a mode in a particular subset and a mode in the other. The temperature difference is greater, on average, if the photons are indistinguishable. This result bolsters a long-standing prediction about the interplay among thermodynamics, information, and quantum particle statistics.

We introduce \\emph{Krylov staggering parameter}, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators."}

Using the full quantum master equation and input-output formalism for two-level systems coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide and driven by a coherent field, we show that an engineered DMI enables strong nonreciprocity in an otherwise reciprocal system, with tunable behavior governed by driving strength, detunings, and phase of the DMI. Using it not only demonstrates nonreciprocal transmission but also demonstrates nonreciprocal quantum entanglement and photon bunching. The system can end up in a pure state as certain decohering channels do not participate. The pure state leads to power-independent perfect transparency. Conditions are derived and depend on the propagation phase, the relative detuning of the two qubits, and the exchange interaction. At these pure-state points, the steady-state entanglement is reciprocal and admits a closed-form expression; away from them, phase control generates strong entanglement nonreciprocity. The DMI also reshapes photon statistics, redistributing two-photon correlations and shifting superbunching from transmission (no DMI) to reflection at finite DMI. These results establish DMI as a versatile resource for engineering nonreciprocity, transparency, entanglement, and photon correlations in waveguide QED, enabling isolators, routers, and superbunching light sources without requiring chiral waveguides."}

We introduce a fully quantum Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for ILP that implements a coherent random walk over the discrete feasible region using only reversible quantum circuits, without quantum-RAM assumptions or classical pre/post-processing. Each walk step is a unitary update that prepares coherent candidate moves, evaluates the objective and constraints reversibly -- including a constraint-satisfaction counter to enforce feasibility -- and encodes Metropolis acceptance amplitudes via a low-overhead linearized rule. At the logical level, the construction uses $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log_2 N)$ qubits to represent $n$ integer variables over the interval $[-N,\\,N-1]$, and the Toffoli-equivalent cost per Metropolis step grows linearly with the total logical qubit count. Using explicit ripple-carry adder constructions, we support linear objectives and mixed equality/inequality constraints. Numerical circuit-level simulations on a broad ensemble of randomly generated instances validate the predicted linear resource scaling and exhibit progressive thermalization toward low-cost feasible solutions under the annealing schedule. Overall, the method provides a coherent, resource-characterized baseline for fully quantum constraint programming and a foundation for incorporating additional quantum speedups in combinatorial optimization."}

For a protocol for a task in QIT, we call a protocol LU invariant if two LU-equivalent states are either both suitable for the protocol or neither is. So far, no one has discussed whether a protocol for a task in QIT is LU invariant. In [Phys. Rev.

In this paper, we show that PTP and PSDC-2 are LU invariant. That is, two LU equivalent states are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 or neither of them is. We show that PSDC-3 is not LU invariant. We also indicate that the teleportation proposed in <cite>Nielsen</cite> is not LU invariant. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a state to be suitable for PTP, PSDC-2, and PSDC-3, respectively. Via the LU invariance of PTP and PSDC-2, we prove that a state is suitable for PTP and PSDC-2 if and only if it has 1 ebit of shared entanglement, respectively and find all genuine entangled states and separable states which are suitable for PTP and PSDC-2, respectively. So far, no one has indicated that PTP and PSDC-2 do not require genuine entanglement. Agrawal and Pati suggested to study if there are subclasses of W SLOCC class which are suitable for PSDC-3.

In conventional trapped-ion schemes, realizing a well-defined, coherent gate typically requires spectrally addressing a specific bus mode. As the ion number increases, the coupling to each individual motional mode becomes weaker, so gates on large ion strings mediated by a single mode are necessarily slow. Moreover, addressing a large number of modes demands complex driving schemes, and the fundamentally perturbative character of these approaches imposes constraints on achievable gate speed and fidelity.\n  Here, we introduce a scheme for entangling trapped-ion qubits using a time-dependent magnetic-field gradient, in which all axial motional modes participate in mediating the interaction and the gate construction is nonperturbative. The framework can be used to implement both multi-qubit gates and two-qubit gates between arbitrary pairs in a linear ion string.

In particular, it is often unclear how collective enhancement, spontaneous emission, and vacuum fluctuations jointly give rise to both paired biphoton generation and unavoidable unpaired background within a single, self-consistent framework. Here we present a fully quantum microscopic theory within a unified Heisenberg--Langevin--Maxwell framework that explicitly incorporates dissipation and quantum noise, thereby revealing the microscopic origin of superradiant biphoton emission in atomic ensembles. The theory provides a consistent description of parametric gain and unpaired noise within the same open-quantum-system framework and applies to both Doppler-free cold atomic ensembles and Doppler-broadened warm vapors. In the high-optical-depth regime, the coupled propagation equations admit analytical solutions, under which the biphoton dynamics rigorously reduce to an effective collective two-level emission process. Within this limit, the biphoton correlation time and spectral properties are shown to obey closed-form scaling relations governed by optical depth and excited-state decoherence. Our results establish a unified microscopic picture of superradiant biphoton generation and clarify the fundamental role of vacuum fluctuations and dissipation in setting the brightness, pairing efficiency, and temporal structure of atomic biphoton sources, with direct relevance to quantum networking and atomic quantum interfaces."}

Recent work has shown that surprisingly simple measurement protocols--comprising only single-qubit measurements--suffice to certify arbitrary $n$-qubit states [Huang, Preskill, Soleimanifar '25; Gupta, He, O'Donnell '25]. However, these certification protocols are not robust: rather than allowing constant $ε_1$, they can only positively certify states within $ε_1=O(1/n)$ trace distance of the target. In many experimental settings, the appropriate error tolerance is constant as the system size grows, so this lack of robustness renders existing tests inapplicable at scale, no matter how many times the test is repeated.\n  Here we present robust certification protocols based on few-qubit measurements that apply to all but a $O(2^{-n})$-fraction of pure target states. Our first protocol achieves constant robustness, i.e. $ε_1=Θ(1)$, using a single $O(\\log n)$-qubit measurement along with single-qubit measurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the other qubits. As a corollary of its robustness, this protocol also achieves constant (in $n$) copy complexity, which is optimal. Our second protocol uses exclusively single-qubit measurements and is nearly robust: $ε_1=Ω(1/\\log n)$. Our tests are based on a new uncertainty principle for conditional fidelities, which may be of independent interest."}

It influences light absorption and emission, affecting energy conversion limits and efficiency. As a result, quantum coherence is being harnessed to boost performance in quantum heat engines, photocells, and photosynthetic-inspired platforms. Of particular interest in this context is the generation of Fano coherences, i.e., the formation of quantum coherences due to the interaction with the continuum of modes characterizing an incoherent process. We aim to formalize mathematically the possibility of achieving steady-state Fano coherence in a V-type three-level quantum system using polarized incoherent radiation, without requiring the energy difference between the excited levels to tend to zero. We perform this analysis by deriving the Bloch-Redfield equation from first-principles by quantizing the incoherent radiation. The resulting reduced dynamics of the system are analysed, so as to determine the lifetime of Fano coherence and identify the conditions under which it becomes stationary. We characterise distinct dynamical regimes, ranging from weak to strong pumping, in which steady-state Fano coherence emerges, and we quantitatively determine its magnitude. For each regime, we analyse the generation of Fano coherence as a function of both the intensity of the incoherent pumping and the energy splitting between the excited levels. We also assess how obtaining Fano coherence is modified by symmetric or asymmetric decay rates. These findings indicate that a three-level quantum system driven by polarized incoherent light can act as a robust resource for coherence-assisted energy conversion and storage. Finally, we discuss the experimental challenges associated with the implementation of the proposed model using an ensemble of Rubidium atoms."}

The aim is to determine which schemes can effectively recover specific properties of input quantum states, including both linear and nonlinear features, while also quantifying the resource requirements in terms of measurements and reservoir dimensionality. We compare standard three-layer QELM with a spatially multiplexed architecture composed of multiple independent three-layer units for linear (quantum) tasks, showing a linear reduction in resource requirements per unit. For nonlinear properties, the study examines the multiple-injection architecture and introduces a novel distributed design that incorporates entanglement between subsystems within a spatially multiplexed framework, evaluating its performance through the reconstruction of complex nonlinear quantities such as polynomial targets, Rényi entropy, and entanglement measures. Our results demonstrate that the distributed design enables the reconstruction of higher-order nonlinearities by increasing the number of interacting subsystems with reduced resources, rather than increasing the size of an individual reservoir, providing a scalable and hardware-efficient route to quantum property learning."}

Therefore, there is a need for a comprehensive study of finite-key effects in the context of direct dual downlink quantum key distribution taking into account the characteristics of the overpass geometries. We develop a high-fidelity model of pair distribution from a low Earth orbit satellite that captures orbital dynamics, elevation-dependent loss, background noise, and extraneous detector effects. We integrate this with a rigorous finite-key security framework for the BBM92 protocol to optimise secret key length across different overpass geometries, orbital altitudes, and optical ground station (OGS) separations.

Classical shadows provide universality with respect to the detector's choice of observables, while the e-detector framework enables explicit control of the average run length (ARL) to false alarm.

However, standard quantum teleportation is fundamentally limited by the quadratic growth of measurement complexity and high classical communication overhead, requiring the resolution of $d^2$ Bell states and $2\\log_2 d$ classical bits. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient high-dimensional coherence teleportation (REHDCT) protocol. By designing $d$ sets of specialized positive operator-valued measure (POVM) bases, our protocol achieves a 50\\% reduction in classical communication by utilizing one of the $d$ designed POVM sets, which effectively scales the measurement complexity from $O(d^2)$ to $O(d)$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that by utilizing initial phase engineering to align the target qudit with the measurement basis, theoretically perfect teleportation of quantum coherence can be achieved for arbitrary qudit states. A quantitative robustness analysis reveals that the protocol remains highly resilient to operational errors, maintaining an efficiency above 99.6\\% even under a 0.1 rad phase deviation for $d=16$. Our analysis under various noise models (amplitude damping, phase flip, depolarizing, and dit-flip) confirms that high-dimensional systems exhibit an expanding quantum advantage window as dimensionality increases. Notably, under dit-flip noise, perfect coherence teleportation can be restored through the optimal selection of the POVM basis.

However, despite promising proof-of-principle results, such methods suffer from high sensitivity to noise (including intrinsic sources such as sampling noise), making their utility for realistic industry-relevant problems an open question. To improve the potential applicability of such methods, we introduce a new variant of thresholding for noisy generalized eigenvalue problems that arise in quantum subspace diagonalization that has the potential to better control sensitivity to noise. Our approach leverages eigenvector-preserving transformations (rotations) of the generalized eigenvalue problem prior to thresholding. We study this effect in practical settings by applying this rotation thresholding scheme to an iterative quantum Krylov algorithm for several chemical systems, including the industry-relevant Fe(III)-NTA chelate complex. We develop a particular heuristic to select the rotation angle from noisy data and find for certain systems and noise regimes that the samples required to reach a target error for ground state estimation can be reduced by a factor of up to 100. Furthermore, with oracle access to the optimal transformation, more dramatic improvements are possible and we observe reductions in sample requirements by up to $10^4$, motivating the continued development of methods that can realize these improvements in practice. While we develop our approach in the context of quantum subspace diagonalization, the improved thresholding scheme we develop could be advantageous in any context where one must solve noisy, ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problems."}

Matrix Product States (MPS) admit more efficient constructions, particularly when accuracy is traded for circuit complexity. Existing approaches to MPS preparation mostly rely on heuristic circuits that are deterministic but quickly saturate in accuracy, or on variational optimization methods that reach high fidelities but scale poorly. This work introduces an end-to-end MPS preparation framework that combines the strengths of both strategies within a single pipeline. Heuristic staircase-like and brick wall disentangler circuits provide warm-start initializations for variational optimization, enabling high-fidelity state preparation for large systems. Target MPSs are either specified as physical quantum states or constructed from classical datasets via amplitude encoding, using step-by-step singular value decompositions or tensor cross interpolation. The framework incorporates entanglement-based qubit reordering, reformulated as a quadratic assignment problem, and low-level optimizations that reduce depths by up to 50% and CNOT counts by 33%. We evaluate the full pipeline on datasets of varying complexity across systems of 19-50 qubits and identify trade-offs between fidelity, gate count, and circuit depth. Optimized brick wall circuits typically achieve the lowest depths, while the optimized staircase-like circuits minimize gate counts. Overall, our results provide principled and scalable protocols for preparing MPSs as quantum circuits, supporting utility-scale applications on near-term quantum devices."}

Then, we proceed by showing that the advantage of considering post-measurement states in measurement discrimination can be large. We formalise this claim by presenting a family of pairs of measurements where the ratio between the discrimination bias of the measurement discrimination task with and without post-measurement states can be arbitrarily large. This shows that, while the post-measurement state was neglected in most of the previous literature, its use can significantly improve the performance of quantum measurement discrimination."}

For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible."}

A key certification task is verifying that a device has produced a desired output state. In this work, we study this task in the context of photonic platforms, where single photons are propagated through linear optical interferometers to create large, entangled resource states for metrology, communication, quantum advantage demonstrations and for so-called linear optical quantum computing (LOQC). This setting derives its computational power from the indistinguishability of the photons, i.e., their relative overlap. Therefore, standard fidelity witnesses developed for distinguishable particles (including qubits) do not apply directly, because they merely certify the closeness to some fixed target state. We introduce a measure of fidelity suitable for this setting and show several different ways to witness it, based on earlier proposals for measuring genuine multi-photon indistinguishability. We argue that a witness based upon the discrete Fourier transform is an optimal choice. We experimentally implement this witness and certify the fidelity of several multi-photon states."}
