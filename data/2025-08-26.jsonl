We show that under special conditions such a system\ncan be equivalently modeled as a two-mechanical-modes optomechanical cavity in\nwhich, besides the standard radiation-pressure coupling, the cavity mode\ninteracts with the mechanical modes through the cross-Kerr (CK), a higher-order\ngeneralized CK, and a three-mode CK type of coupling. Furthermore, there is an\ninduced CK coupling between the two-mechanical modes. Assuming that the cavity\nmode is simultaneously driven by a strong control field and a weak probe field,\nwe analyze the response of the output probe field affected by the\nabove-mentioned nonlinear couplings. In particular, our results reveal that the\nhigher-order nonlinear CK and the three-mode CK couplings have remarkable\nimpact on the characteristics of the OMIT and OMIA phenomena. Moreover, we find\nthat these nonlinear couplings can give rise to the occurrence of the gain in\nthe absorption profile and contribute to the amplification of the output probe\nfield in specific frequency regions. We also show that the system offers\ntunable switching between slow and fast light behaviors. The proposed hybrid\noptomechanical circuit may find potential applications in light propagation,\nquantum sensing of physical quantities, and information processing."}

These new inquiries extend to investigations at the\nintersection of phenomenology and QBism. Philosopher of physics Steven French\nhas criticized QBism on the grounds that it does not give assurances that\nWigner and friend must agree on the same quantum state or the same set of facts\nin the experiment. In this paper, we draw on Wigner's Friend to argue that\nintersubjective agreement on quantum states is unnecessary. We defend the QBist\nnotion of reciprocity, treating Wigner and friend as \"peer observers\" or\nphysical systems taking mutual actions on each other. We argue that accounts of\nintersubjectivity that preserve the possibility of privileged observation,\nvantage points for solipsistic super-observers, undermine the epistemic\nbenefits we look for when we insist on intersubjectivity agreement as a\ncriterion for objectivity. In its place, the QBist notion of reciprocity leads\nto sharper characterization of what it means to objectify quantum systems with\na quantum state assignment. Drawing on phenomenological resources, we argue\nthat state assignments for quantum systems, including those for Wigner and\nfriend, are thematizations. To assign a quantum state is to thematize a\nphenomenon as a quantum system, to treat something as the sort of object to\nwhich the formalism applies.

The key\ninsight is that most quantum operation protocols maintain the system in nearly\npure states throughout their execution. This enables an efficient\nrepresentation of the density matrix with rank-$M$ matrices where $M \\ll N$ ,\n$N$ being the Hilbert space dimension, achieving substantial speedups without\nsacrificing accuracy. We benchmark our approach on the optimization of the\ntransmon qubit dispersive readout in a realistic transmon-resonator-filter\nmodel with Hilbert space dimension $N = 2000$. Using only $M = 20$, we achieve\nan 81-fold speedup compared to full master equation integration while\naccurately reproducing all relevant observables. By combining the low-rank\napproximation with a compact pulse parametrization and gradient-free\noptimization, we obtain state-of-the-art readout assignment errors\n$\\varepsilon_a \\approx 1.2 \\times 10^{-3}$ for a 40 ns readout pulse schedule,\nwhile comfortably running on a laptop and not relying on the rotating-wave\napproximation. Our approach is broadly applicable to most quantum control\nprotocols, including quantum gates, state preparation, and fast reset\noperations. It represents a powerful resource and a step forward in quantum\noptimal control, making accurate large-scale device optimization more\naccessible with greatly reduced computational resources and accelerating\nprogress toward scalable quantum technologies."}

While entanglement is\nhindered by thermalization when the system and environment exchange a conserved\nquantity, we demonstrate that breaking this conservation law through the\nsystem-environment interaction drives the system to a nonequilibrium steady\nstate. Such an interaction will generate multiple competing equilibration\nchannels, effectively mimicking baths at distinct chemical potentials. When the\nenvironment also supports long-range correlations, these channels mediate\nnonlocal dissipation capable of generating entanglement. We illustrate the\nscheme in a model of two color centers weakly coupled to a spin-pumped magnet,\nwhere tuneable magnon excitations enable steady-state entanglement over finite\ndistances. Our results outline a scalable approach to dissipative entanglement\ngeneration, rooted in the conservation structure and environmental correlations\nrather than fine-tuned coherent control or active driving."}

Quantum computers are a\npromising platform to simulate the dynamics of open quantum systems aided by\nintrinsic hardware-noise, with successful demonstrations of models with two\nelectronic sites. We simulated a microscopic model of electron-transfer (ET)\nwith a single donor and up to nine acceptor sites on a superconducting\nprocessor of IBM, using a model-specific error mitigation scheme. Our results\nusing up to 20 qubits reveal a probability of ET that is well aligned with\nclassical calculations where electronic and vibronic transfer resonances can be\nidentified at the expected driving forces. We conducted 10 independent\nexperiments per system size on different days, accounting for hourly\nfluctuations in error rates. We find that the most important ingredient for\nlarge-scale simulations is a large number of available qubits connected by\nhigh-fidelity gates, with coherence times above the threshold set by the target\nopen system. Because the vibronic mechanism of electron transfer is\nentanglement-driven, our simulation is a natural application-based benchmark,\nin which the hardware capacity to produce and sustain entanglement is\nquantified by the maximum system size for which the hardware produces accurate\nresults."}

Mapping this challenge onto a graph-based problem,\nspecifically the Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) problem, allows it to\nbe addressed by specialized hardware such as neutral-atom quantum processors.\nHowever, a significant bottleneck has been the size mismatch between\nbiologically relevant molecular systems and the limited capacity of near-term\nquantum devices. In this work, we overcome this scaling limitation by the use\nof a novel divide-and-conquer heuristic introduced in Cazals et al. This\nalgorithm enables the solution of large-scale MWIS problems by decomposing a\nsingle, intractable graph instance into smaller sub-problems that can be solved\nsequentially on a neutral-atom quantum emulator, incurring only a linear\ncomputational overhead. We demonstrate the power of this approach by solving a\n540-node MWIS problem representing the docking of an inhibitor to the Tumor\nnecrosis factor-$\\alpha$ Converting Enzyme--thiol-containing Aryl Sulfonamide\n(TACE-AS) complex. Our work enables the application of quantum methods to more\ncomplex and physically realistic molecular systems than previously possible,\npaving the way for tackling large-scale docking challenges on near-term quantum\nhardware."}

It explores how the\ndiscarded qubit states of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) quantum\nconvolutional neural networks (QCNNs) can be leveraged alongside a classical\nclassifier to improve classification performance. Current QCNNs discard qubit\nstates after pooling; yet, unlike classical pooling, these qubits often remain\nentangled with the retained ones, meaning valuable correlated information is\nlost. We experiment with recycling this information and combining it with the\nconventional measurements from the retained qubits. Accordingly, we propose a\nhybrid quantum-classical architecture that couples a modified QCNN with fully\nconnected classical layers. Two shallow fully connected (FC) heads separately\nprocess measurements from retained and discarded qubits, whose outputs are\nensembled before a final classification layer. Joint optimisation with a\nclassical cross-entropy loss allows both quantum and classical parameters to\nadapt coherently. The method outperforms comparable lightweight models on\nMNIST, Fashion-MNIST and OrganAMNIST. These results indicate that reusing\ndiscarded qubit information is a promising approach for future hybrid\nquantum-classical models and may extend to tasks beyond image classification."}

Analogous to zero-field cooling and field\ncooling in conventional magnetic materials, an annealing protocol is devised to\ncontrol the energy in an isolated system. Depending on the strength of\ndisorder, the susceptibilities at zero field bifurcate at a specific energy,\nwhich signals the presence of different magnetic regimes. This behavior is\napparent both in a numerical simulation by exact diagonalization of the\nHeisenberg Hamiltonian with twelve particles, as well as in an experiment with\nthousands of Rydberg atoms representing dipolar interacting quantum spins. The\nannealing protocols open a new path to explore the energy-dependent phase\nstructure of spin systems at low energies. Our observation of a nonthermal\nmetastable regime might indicate the existence of a phase transition to a novel\nstate of isolated quantum spin systems."}
