However, ensuring the correctness of these libraries remains a fundamental challenge due to the lack of mature testing methodologies. The state-of-the-art tools often rely on domain-specific configurations and expert knowledge, which limits their accessibility and scalability in practice. Furthermore, although these tools demonstrate strong performance, they adopt measurement-based for output validation in testing, which makes them produce false positive reports.\n  To alleviate these limitations, we propose QSPE, a practical approach that follows the differential testing principle and extends the existing approach, SPE, for quantum libraries. QSPE is fully automated, requiring no pre-set configurations or domain expertise, and can effectively generate a large set of diverse program variants that comprehensively explore the quantum compilation space. To mitigate the possible false positive reports, we propose statevector-based validation as an alternative to measurement-based validation. In our experiments, the QSPE approach demonstrates remarkable effectiveness in generating 22,770 program variants across multiple quantum computing platforms. By avoiding $α$-equivalence at the quantum and classical program wise, QSPE can reduce redundant generation and save more than 90\\% of execution cost. Finally, the statevector-based validation method assists QSPE to reduce false alarms and effectively detects 708 miscompilations across multiple quantum libraries. Notably, 81 of the discovered bugs have been officially approved and acknowledged by the Qiskit development team, demonstrating the practical impact of our approach."}

The availability of large-scale data and advanced computational power enables the development of sophisticated models and training strategies, leading to state-of-the-art performance, but it also introduces substantial challenges. Quantum Computing (QC), which exploits quantum mechanisms for computation, has attracted growing attention and significant global investment as it may address these challenges. Consequently, Quantum Machine Learning (QML), the integration of these two fields, has received increasing interest, with a notable rise in related studies in recent years. We are motivated to review these existing contributions regarding quantum circuit-based learning models for classical data analysis and highlight the identified potentials and challenges of this technique. Specifically, we focus not only on QML models, both kernel-based and neural network-based, but also on recent explorations of their integration with classical machine learning layers within hybrid frameworks. Moreover, we examine both theoretical analysis and empirical findings to better understand their capabilities, and we also discuss the efforts on noise-resilient and hardware-efficient QML that could enhance its practicality under current hardware limitations. In addition, we cover several emerging paradigms for advanced quantum circuit design and highlight the adaptability of QML across representative application domains. This study aims to provide an overview of the contributions made to bridge quantum computing and machine learning, offering insights and guidance to support its future development and pave the way for broader adoption in the coming years."}

In this study, we propose a hybrid approach utilizing a quantum computing-based optimization algorithm integrated with classical pre-processing to expedite the genome assembly process. Specifically, we present a method to solve the Hamiltonian and Eulerian paths within the genome assembly graph using gate-based quantum computing through a Higher-Order Binary Optimization (HOBO) formulation with the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm (VQE), in addition to a novel bitstring recovery mechanism to improve optimizer traversal of the solution space. A comparative analysis with classical optimization techniques was performed to assess the effectiveness of our quantum-based approach in genome assembly.

We derive an evolution equation for the moment generating function for this work, faithfully capturing the thermodynamic signature of coherent superpositions in the initial ensemble. We demonstrate that different initial ensembles that correspond to the same density matrix upon ensemble average, while having the same average work, display different work fluctuations. For monotonic driving, we show that fluctuations are maximum for coherence-less initial ensembles. As an application, we consider quantum bit-erasure in finite time and demonstrate significantly different work statistics for erasing a classical bit of information versus a Haar random initial ensemble. Our results indicate that coherence in the initial ensemble can be utilized as a resource for thermodynamic precision without incurring additional dissipative work costs. We also obtain a generalized fluctuation theorem that establishes a new quantum lower bound on the mean dissipated work. This bound, counterintuitively, is also applicable to a \"classical\" initial ensemble with the same initial density matrix and is connected to quantum absolute irreversibility."}

Here we investigate how the complexity of such trajectories is affected by conservation laws and other dynamical constraints of the underlying Lindblad evolution. We characterize this complexity using a data-driven approach based on the intrinsic dimension, defined as the minimal number of variables required to encode the information contained in a data set. Applying this framework to several systems, including dissipative variants of the quantum top and of the XXZ chain, we find that the intrinsic dimension is sensitive to the structure of their dynamics. The Lindblad evolution in these systems is typically chaotic, but additional constraints arise at specific parameter values, where the dynamics becomes integrable, exhibits Hilbert-space fragmentation, or develops a closed BBGKY hierarchy, leading to pronounced minima in the intrinsic dimension. Our approach results in an unsupervised probe of the complexity of dissipative quantum systems that is sensitive to chaos and ergodicity breaking phenomena beyond the initial transient regime."}

We focus on the paradigmatic disordered spin-$1\\!/2$ XXZ chain and its impurity variant with local interactions. Across highly excited eigenstates, FAF evolves from typical-state behavior at weak disorder to strongly suppressed values deep in the MBL regime, with volume-law scaling in the XXZ chain and an area-law bound in the impurity setting. Rare long range catlike eigenstates exhibit a pronounced enhancement of FAF, making it a sensitive diagnostic of mechanisms proposed to destabilize MBL. Starting from product states, we find that in the MBL regime FAF grows slowly in time, approaching saturation via a power-law relaxation. Overall, our results show that MBL suppresses fermionic non-Gaussianity, and the associated complexity beyond free fermions, while ergodicity restores it, motivating explorations of fermionic non-Gaussianity in other ergodicity-breaking phenomena."}

Different from traditional parametrically induced magnons with degenerate frequencies, we achieve non-degenerate excitations by coupling magnon modes simultaneously with two cavity photon modes. Through the magnon-photon interactions in the corresponding linear and nonlinear regimes, one input microwave photon splits into a pair of magnon polaritons that possess distinct frequencies but maintain strong inter-mode correlations. The nonlinear magnon polariton dynamics empowered by this new parametric platform brings both verified true randomness and robust multi-channel correlations, from which we construct a microwave communication experiment for noise resilient signal transmission with added security.

Our results reveal a clear hierarchy in the sensitivity of these observables: the relaxation value of the entanglement entropy varies smoothly as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters across the chaos-regular transition, while the imbalance exhibits a more pronounced distinction. Most notably, the survival probability emerges as the most robust indicator of the transition between chaos and regularity. When appropriately scaled, all three observables converge onto a common behavior as a function of the Hamiltonian parameters for different numbers of sites and bosons,enabling a universal characterization of the transition between chaotic and regular dynamics."}

Crucially, this local-to-global synchronization contrasts with schemes requiring spatially extensive reservoirs: here, a strictly local dissipative seed suffices to establish coherence across the interacting system. We elucidate the mechanism via local dark-state selection, controlled elimination of off-manifold excursions induced by hopping, and a Liouvillian invariant-subspace structure that yields an attractive fixed point with a finite dissipative gap. Furthermore, we classify the stability of this NESS against static disorder, identifying a broad regime where the superconducting attractor is resilient to Hamiltonian perturbations that leave the effective subspace structure intact, while pinpointing specific perturbations that directly dephase the $η$-pseudospin coherence and suppress ODLRO.

Despite these parallel perspectives, the relation between LGC and BIC formation has remained largely unexplored. Here we bridge this gap in a paradigmatic giant-atom waveguide platform and show that the occurrence of LGC necessarily benchmarks the presence of a BIC in the full Hamiltonian description. By engineering the giant-atom geometry, we further demonstrate rich dynamical regimes-including Rabi oscillations, fractional decay, and complete exponential relaxation-depending on the number of supported BICs, which can be tuned from three to zero. Remarkably, when two BICs become frequency-degenerate, the long-time dynamics approaches a steady state rather than exhibiting persistent oscillations.

Here, we provide a comparative numerical study of single-step-QRC (SS-QRC) and multi-step-QRC (MS-QRC) architectures implemented on a Rydberg atom array. We demonstrate that while MS-QRC performance is highly sensitive to the underlying dynamical phase of matter and decoherence, SS-QRC exhibits greater robustness. Using the randomized measurement toolbox to mitigate measurement overhead, we reveal that sampling noise undermines the convergence property required for MS-QRC. This leads to a significant reduction in the information processing capacity (IPC) of MS-QRC, deteriorating its performance on nonlinear time-series benchmarks. In contrast, SS-QRC maintains high IPC and accuracy across both temporal and non-temporal tasks.

Here, we theoretically investigate the quantum geometry of Dirac EPs realized in nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, utilizing fidelity susceptibility as a probe. We demonstrate that despite the absence of a symmetry-breaking phase transition, the Dirac EP induces a pronounced geometric singularity, confirming the validity of fidelity in characterizing non-Hermitian EPs. Specifically, the real part of the fidelity susceptibility diverges to negative infinity, which serves as a signature of non-Hermitian criticality. Crucially, however, we reveal that this divergence exhibits a distinct anisotropy, diverging along the non-reciprocal coupling direction while remaining finite along the detuning axis. This behavior stands in stark contrast to the omnidirectional divergence observed in conventional EPs. Our findings provide a comprehensive picture of the fidelity probe near the Dirac EP, highlighting the critical role of parameter directionality in exploiting Dirac EPs for quantum control and sensing applications."}

Here, we present a sparse-sampling strategy for reconstructing high-resolution wide-field images from only a small number of measurements. Using simulated NV-ensemble detection of ac magnetic fields, we show that a mean-adjusted Bayesian estimation (MABE) framework can reconstruct 10000-pixel images from only 25 sampling points, achieving SSIM values exceeding 0.999 for representative smooth field distributions, while optimized dynamical-decoupling pulse sequences yield an approximately twofold improvement in magnetic-field sensitivity.

In this work, we quantify the entrywise resolvability of the Hessian for Variational Quantum Algorithms at random initialization. By leveraging exact second-order parameter-shift rules, we derive a structural representation that reduces the variance of Hessian entries to a finite covariance quadratic form of shifted cost evaluations. This framework reveals two distinct scaling regimes that govern the sample complexity required to resolve Hessian entries against shot noise. For global objectives, we prove that Hessian variances are exponentially suppressed, implying that the number of measurement shots must scale as $O(e^{αn})$ with the number of qubits $n$ to maintain a constant signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, for termwise local objectives in bounded-depth circuits, the variance decay is polynomial and explicitly controlled by the backward lightcone growth on the interaction graph, ensuring that curvature information remains statistically accessible with $O(\\mathrm{poly}(n))$ shots. Extensive numerical experiments across varying system sizes and circuit depths demonstrate these theoretical bounds and the associated sampling costs.

Mathematically, these devices are described by bistochastic quantum channels, namely completely positive linear maps that are both trace-preserving and identity-preserving. Recently, it has been shown that bidirectional quantum devices can, in principle, be used in ways that are incompatible with a definite input-output direction, giving rise to a new phenomenon called input-output indefiniteness. Here we characterize the most general forms of input-output indefiniteness, associated with a hierarchy of higher-order transformations built from transformations of bistochastic quantum channels. Some levels of the hierarchy correspond to transformations that combine bistochastic channels in a definite causal order, while generally using each channel in an indefinite input-output direction. For other levels of the hierarchy, the indefiniteness can involve both the local input-output direction of each process and the global causal order among the processes. On the foundational side, the hierarchy of higher-order transformations characterized here can be regarded as the largest set of physical processes compatible with a time-symmetric variant of quantum theory, where the possible state transformations are restricted to bistochastic channels."}

Remarkably, the time-averaged asymmetry exhibits clear signatures of the dynamical critical point, in close correspondence with both the dynamical order parameter and the behavior of entropy production. We further uncover a quantitative link between asymmetry generation and thermodynamic irreversibility, showing that peaks in asymmetry coincide with maximal entropy production across the transition. Our results position asymmetry as a unifying concept bridging symmetry, information-theoretic quantifiers, and nonequilibrium thermodynamics in dynamical quantum phase transitions, providing a powerful framework for understanding critical dynamics beyond traditional order parameters."}

In particular, when these couplings are comparable, decoherence is dramatically suppressed at exceptional transitions. We trace this behavior to the distinct response of the environmental ground state near non-Hermitian degeneracies and demonstrate the robustness of the effect across multiple models.

We demonstrate that the proposed definition naturally decomposes into a Clausius-type entropy production and an additional contribution arising from the time dependence of the effective temperature. Furthermore, we show that requiring the entropy production rate to take the conventional form as the sum of the entropy change and the heat flow constrains the effective temperature to be either constant or equal to a specific energy-matching effective temperature. For general initial states, entropy production can become negative, in which case we derive lower bounds on entropy production and establish sufficient conditions for its non-negativity using the trace distance."}

By introducing an auxiliary operator, we convert the history-dependent work variance into a time-local integral, enabling efficient gradient-based optimization beyond slow or rapid driving regimes. Applying our method, we find that in the coherent spin-boson model the optimized protocol can switch discontinuously between distinct locally optimal solutions as the relative weight between dissipation and fluctuations is varied. Moreover, for a single-level quantum dot coupled to a fermionic reservoir, the optimized fluctuation-minimizing protocol develops a qualitatively different multi-step structure that is not captured by approaches based on slow- or rapid-driving limits."}

As a result, our method enables the target simulation precision to be reached with approximately half the circuit depth compared to conventional MPF schemes.

But, recent works have established that in many situations such Markovian descriptions are fundamentally limited: they cannot simultaneously capture populations and coherences even to the leading-order in system-bath couplings. This can cause violation of fundamental properties like thermalization and continuity equations associated with local conservation laws, even when such properties are expected in the actual setting. This begs the question: given a physical situation, how do we know if there exists an LE that describes it to a desired accuracy? Here we show that, for both equilibrium and non-equilibrium steady states (NESS), this question can be succinctly formulated as a semidefinite program (SDP), a convex optimization technique. If a solution to the SDP can be found to a desired accuracy, then an LE description is possible for the chosen setting. If not, no LE description is fundamentally attainable, showing that a consistent Markovian treatment is impossible even at weak system-bath coupling for that particular setting. Considering few qubit isotropic XXZ-type models coupled to multiple baths, we find that in most parameter regimes, LE description giving accurate populations and coherences to leading-order is unattainable, leading to rigorous no-go results. However, in some cases, LE description having correct populations but inaccurate coherences, and satisfying local conservation laws, is possible over some of the parameter regimes. Our work highlights the power of semidefinite programming in the analysis of physically consistent LEs, thereby, in understanding the limits of Markovian descriptions at weak system-bath couplings."}

A promising route to understanding this quantum thermalization is the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which posits that individual energy eigenstates already appear locally thermal. Subsequent studies have extended this concept to the full ETH, which captures higher-order correlations among matrix elements through nontrivial relations. In this work, we perform a detailed exact-diagonalization study of finite-size corrections to these relations in the canonical ensemble. We distinguish two distinct sources of corrections: those arising from energy fluctuations, which decay polynomially with system size, and those originating from fluctuations within each energy window, which decay exponentially with system size. In particular, our analysis resolves the puzzle that, for certain observables, finite-size corrections exhibit anomalous growth with increasing system size even in chaotic systems. Our results provide a systematic and practical methodology for validating the full ETH in quantum many-body systems."}

This correspondence has been used to establish the classical hardness of simulating interacting spin systems by relating their output distributions to #P-hard quantities. Previous works, however, have largely been restricted to bipartite spin interactions, where transition amplitudes, which provide the leading-order contribution to the output probabilities, are proportional to the permanent. In this work, we extend the Ising model construction to arbitrary interaction networks and show that transition amplitudes of the Ising Hamiltonian are proportional to the hafnian and the loop-hafnian. The loop-hafnian generalizes both the permanent and hafnian, but unlike these cases, loop-hafnian-based states require Dicke-like superpositions, making the design of corresponding quantum circuits non-trivial. Our results establish a unified framework linking bosonic networks of single photons and Gaussian states with quantum spin dynamics and matrix functions. This unification not only broadens the theoretical foundation of quantum circuit models but also highlights new, diverse, and classically intractable applications."}

In this structure, the number of repetitions of the basic circuit pattern is associated to convergence parameters. This iterative structure behaves similarly to function approximation by series expansion: the higher the truncation order, the better the target gate (i.e. operation) approximation. The asymptotic convergence of the gate error with respect to the number of basic pattern repetitions is known. It is referred to as the query complexity. The underlying convergence law is bounded, but not in an explicit fashion. Upper bounds are generally too pessimistic to be useful in practice. The actual convergence law contains constants that depend on the joint properties of the matrix encoded by the query and the initial state vector, which are difficult to compute classically. This paper proposes a strategy to study this convergence law and extract the associated constants from the gate (operation) approximation at different accuracy (convergence parameter) constructed directly on a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). This protocol is called Numerical Error Extraction by Quantum Measurement Algorithm (NEEQMA). NEEQMA concepts are tested on specific instances of Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) and Hamiltonian Simulation by Trotterization. Knowing theexact convergence constants allows for selecting the smallest convergence parameters that enable reaching the required gate approximation accuracy, hence satisfying the quantum algorithm's requirements."}

Here, we construct and investigate a Liouvillian exceptional structure based on a driven-dissipative Kerr-cat qubit. Through numerical simulations, we reveal a quantum phase transition occurring at the LEP characterized by a sudden change in dynamical behavior from underdamped oscillations to overdamped relaxations as visualized via Wigner functions and Bloch sphere trajectories. Notably the negativity of the Wigner function serves as a direct signature of genuine quantum coherence unattainable in conventional single-qubit non-Hermitian systems. Furthermore, we introduce the phase difference between the off-diagonal elements of the Liouvillian eigenmatrices as a novel parameter to quantify the transition. Our results establish the Kerr-cat qubit as a novel continuous-variable setting for exploring dissipative quantum criticality and intrinsic non-Hermitian physics."}

Applied to protocols that drive an initial Gibbs state toward a quasi-Gibbs target, these bounds yield an explicit threshold driving rate for the onset of nonadiabaticity. For a broad class of local Hamiltonians in gapped phases, we show that, in the thermodynamic limit, the threshold factorizes into two factors: a system-size contribution that recovers the zero-temperature scaling and a universal temperature-dependent factor. The latter is exponentially close to unity at low temperature, whereas at high temperature it increases linearly with temperature. We verify the predicted scaling in several spin-1/2 chains by obtaining closed-form expressions for the threshold driving rate.

We measure background quasiparticle tunneling rates at the single-hertz level, with temporal resolution of tens of microseconds. Using time-tagged coincidence analysis, we show that individual events are uncorrelated across devices, whereas burst episodes occur about once per minute and are largely correlated.

In addition, we identify a rarer subset of bursts which are accompanied by a shift in the offset charge, at approximately one event per hour.

Approximate quantum loaders (AQLs) provide a viable solution to this problem by balancing fidelity and circuit complexity. However, most existing AQL methods are either heuristic or provide guarantees only for specific input types, and a general theoretical framework is still lacking. To address this gap, here we reformulate most AQL methods into a unified framework and establish information-theoretic bounds on their approximation error. Our analysis reveals that the achievable infidelity between the prepared state and target state scales linearly with the total entanglement entropy across subsystems when the loading circuit is applied to the target state. In light of this, we develop AQER, a scalable AQL method that constructs the loading circuit by systematically reducing entanglement in target states. We conduct systematic experiments to evaluate the effectiveness of AQER, using synthetic datasets, classical image and language datasets, and a quantum many-body state datasets with up to 50 qubits.

Tensor networks are an invaluable tool for efficiently representing states of large quantum systems with limited entanglement. Algorithms for sampling one-dimensional (1D) tensor networks are well-established and utilized in several 1D tensor network methods. In this paper we introduce two novel sampling algorithms for two-dimensional (2D) isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) that can be viewed as extensions of algorithms for 1D tensor networks. The first algorithm we propose performs independent sampling and yields a single configuration together with its associated probability. The second algorithm employs a greedy search strategy to identify K high-probability configurations and their corresponding probabilities. Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of these algorithms across quantum states with varying entanglement and system size."}

This task has recently attracted significant attention, as the secure instantiation of many isogeny-based cryptographic protocols relies on the ability to sample such ``hard'' curves. Existing approaches, however, achieve this only in a trusted-setup setting. We present the first provable quantum polynomial-time algorithm that samples a random hard supersingular elliptic curve with high probability.Our algorithm runs heuristically in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{4}p\\right)$ quantum gate complexity and in $\\tilde{O}\\!\\left(\\log^{13} p\\right)$ under the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. As a consequence, our algorithm gives a secure instantiation of the CGL hash function and other cryptographic primitives.\n  Our analysis relies on a new spectral delocalization result for supersingular $\\ell$-isogeny graphs: we prove the Quantum Unique Ergodicity conjecture, and we further provide numerical evidence for complete eigenvector delocalization; this theoretical result may be of independent interest. Along the way, we prove a stronger $\\varepsilon$-separation property for eigenvalues of isogeny graphs than that predicted in the quantum money protocol of Kane, Sharif, and Silverberg, thereby removing a key heuristic assumption in their construction."}

These two-spin techniques are widely used to create nonequilibrium nuclear spin states having polarization far beyond its equilibrium value. OE is commonly encountered in liquids, and SE is a solid-state technique. Here, we report a single framework based on a recently proposed quantum master equation, to explain both OE and SE. To this end, we use a fluctuation-regularized quantum master equation that predicts dipolar relaxation and drive-induced dissipation, in addition to the standard environmental dissipation channels. Importantly, this unified approach predicts the existence of optimal microwave drive amplitudes that maximize the OE and SE enhancements. We also report optimal enhancement regime for electron-nuclear coupling for maximal enhancement."}

Thai"], "title": "Guaranteeing Privacy in Hybrid Quantum Learning through Theoretical Mechanisms", "comment": null, "summary": "Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is becoming increasingly prevalent due to its potential to enhance classical machine learning (ML) tasks, such as classification. Although quantum noise is often viewed as a major challenge in quantum computing, it also offers a unique opportunity to enhance privacy. In particular, intrinsic quantum noise provides a natural stochastic resource that, when rigorously analyzed within the differential privacy (DP) framework and composed with classical mechanisms, can satisfy formal $(\\varepsilon, δ)$-DP guarantees. This enables a reduction in the required classical perturbation without compromising the privacy budget, potentially improving model utility. However, the integration of classical and quantum noise for privacy preservation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose a hybrid noise-added mechanism, HYPER-Q, that combines classical and quantum noise to protect the privacy of QML models. We provide a comprehensive analysis of its privacy guarantees and establish theoretical bounds on its utility. Empirically, we demonstrate that HYPER-Q outperforms existing classical noise-based mechanisms in terms of adversarial robustness across multiple real-world datasets."}

For this purpose, exact discrete versions of the path integral are constructed for three different orderings of the Hamiltonian: normal, anti-normal and symmetric (Weyl order). Subsequently, their different continuum versions are checked on the harmonic oscillator, to choose the symmetric ordering as a possibly correct choice for all Hamiltonians. Spotted mathematical subtleties in the simple case serve as a clue to the general solution. Finally, a general justification for the symmetric order is provided by deriving the continuum path integral starting from the exact discrete case by a renormalization procedure in the imaginary time frequency domain. While the role of Weyl order has already been found, the paper provides the missing proof of its suitability for every Hamiltonian and simplifies the previously established construction by referring only to creation and annihilation operators (without position and momentum operators)."}
