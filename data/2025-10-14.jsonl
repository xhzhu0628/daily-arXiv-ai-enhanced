It\nserves as a witness of nonclassicality and provides both upper and lower bounds\non the Hilbert-Schmidt distance to the set of classical (spin coherent) states.\nWe demonstrate that many hallmark properties of the QCS carry over to the spin\nsetting, including its links to noise susceptibility of a state and moments of\nquasiprobability distributions. The spin coherence scale has direct\nimplications for quantum metrology in the guise of rotation sensing.

To appear in: Studies in History and\n  Philosophy of Science: Special Issue on The London-Bauer-French\n  Interpretation", "summary": "In this article I compare two interpretations of quantum mechanics (QM) that\ndraw inspiration from phenomenology: the London-Bauer-French interpretation\n(hereafter LBF) as articulated by Steven French, and QBism. I give special\nattention to certain disagreements between QBism and LBF identified French's\nwork, as well as French's related claims that QBism may be at odds with key\nideas in phenomenology. My main finding is that QBism does not fare so badly\nwith phenomenology as French makes out; in particular it can be made compatible\nwith Zahavi's correlationism and Husserl's notion of intersubjectivity, both of\nwhich strongly inform LBF. Nevertheless, I concur with French's argument that\nQBism is incompatible with the conception of quantum measurement in LBF, hence\nalso with that of Merleau-Ponty, as the latter based his own analysis on that\nof London and Bauer. I explain why I find QBism's account preferable in this\ncase."}

Most ensemble-based realizations rely on dark-state polaritons\n(DSPs) in $\\Lambda$-type systems that operate at near-infrared wavelengths,\nsuch as 795 nm in $^{87}$Rb, far from the telecom band where long fiber\ntransmission is optimal. Here we identify a DSP in $^{87}$Rb that coherently\ncouples two photonic modes at 795 nm and 1324 nm through a shared spin-wave\ncoherence. We derive its field operator and group velocity, extending the\nFleischhauer-Lukin model to a dual-wavelength regime, and formulate a memory\nprotocol enabling bidirectional storage and retrieval between the two modes.\nNumerical simulations of the full six-level dynamics confirm two-way storage\nand retrieval for both same-mode and cross-mode operation between the two\nwavelengths. The results demonstrate a dual-wavelength memory that unifies\nnode-band and telecom-band operation within a single ensemble, providing a\npotential route toward frequency-conversion-free quantum-network interfaces."}

Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, neural network-based\ndecoders have emerged as a promising approach to enhance the reliability of\nQEC. We propose the Hierarchical Qubit-Merging Transformer (HQMT), a novel and\ngeneral decoding framework that explicitly leverages the structural graph of\nstabilizer codes to learn error correlations across multiple scales. Our\narchitecture first computes attention locally on structurally related groups of\nstabilizers and then systematically merges these qubit-centric representations\nto build a global view of the error syndrome. The proposed HQMT achieves\nsubstantially lower logical error rates for surface codes by integrating a\ndedicated qubit-merging layer within the transformer architecture. Across\nvarious code distances, HQMT significantly outperforms previous neural\nnetwork-based QEC decoders as well as a powerful belief propagation with\nordered statistics decoding (BP+OSD) baseline. This hierarchical approach\nprovides a scalable and effective framework for surface code decoding,\nadvancing the realization of reliable quantum computing."}

However, the existence of such modes requires\nfine-tuning the system to satisfy specific symmetry constraints. We investigate\nthe response of spin systems that possess such oscillating modes to generic,\nweak perturbations. We show that even when these perturbations break the\nsymmetry and lead to a single steady state, the phase correlations in the\nresulting state exhibit signatures of synchronization. Our results therefore\nconnect the persistent oscillation notion (dynamical) and the notion based on\nphase correlations (steady-state) of synchronization, which so far have been\nregarded as distinct phenomena. Furthermore, we demonstrate that steady-state\nsynchronization in these systems can exhibit features that are absent in the\ndynamical synchronization. Our work suggests robustness of synchronization and\npoints toward a potential unifying framework of quantum synchronization."}

However, the error analysis of product formulas is\nchallenging, and their cost is often overestimated. It is established that\nTrotter error can be bounded in terms of spectral norms of nested commutators\nof the Hamiltonian partitions [Childs et al., Phys. Rev. X 11, 011020], but\nevaluating these expressions is challenging, often achieved by repeated\napplication of the triangle inequality, significantly loosening the bound.\nHere, we show that the spectral norm of an operator can be upper bounded by the\nspectral norm of an equivalent sign-problem-free operator, which can be\ncalculated efficiently to large system sizes using projector Monte Carlo\nsimulation. For a range of Hamiltonians and considering second-order formulas,\nwe demonstrate that this Monte Carlo-based bound is often extremely tight, and\neven exact in some instances. For the uniform electron gas we reduce the cost\nof performing Trotterization from the literature by an order of magnitude. For\nthe Pariser-Parr-Pople model for linear acene molecules, which has\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ long-range interaction terms, we show that it suffices to\nuse $\\mathcal{O}(N^{0.57})$ Trotter steps and circuit depth\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{1.57})$ to implement Hamiltonian simulation. We hope that this\napproach will lead to a better understanding of the potential accuracy of\nTrotterization in a range of important applications."}

However,\nhigh-energy dynamics, such as the formation of quark-gluon plasmas, is\nnotoriously difficult to model with classical methods. Quantum simulation\noffers a promising alternative in this regime, yet experiments have mainly\nprobed low energies. Here, we observe the formation of a ballistic plasma and\nlong-time memory effects in high-energy gauge theory dynamics on a\nhigh-precision quantum simulator. Both observations are unexpected, as the\ninitial state - fully filled with particle-antiparticle pairs - was thought to\nrapidly thermalize. Instead, we find correlations spreading ballistically to\nlong distances and a memory of charge clusters. Our observations cannot be\nexplained by many-body scars, but are captured by a new theory of plasma\noscillations between electric field and current operators, persisting all the\nway to the continuum limit of the (1+1)D Schwinger model, of which we simulate\na lattice version. Adapting techniques from quantum optics, we visualize plasma\noscillations as rotations of Wigner distributions, leading to a novel set of\npredictions which we test in experiment and numerics. The new framework\nencompasses both our scenario and scars, which show up as coherent states of\nthe plasma. The experimental surprises we observe in the high-energy dynamics\nof a simple gauge theory point to the potential of high-precision quantum\nsimulations of gauge theories for general scientific discovery."}

Tracing the time evolution of a large number of initial states,\nwe find that the anti-flatness exhibits a barrier-like maximum during the time\nperiod when the entanglement entropy of the subsystem grows rapidly from the\ninitial value to the microcanonical entropy. The location of the peak is\nstrongly correlated with the time when the entanglement exhibits the strongest\ngrowth. This behavior is found for generic highly excited initial computational\nbasis states and persists for coupling constants across the ergodic regime,\nrevealing a universal structure of the entanglement spectrum during\nthermalization. We conclude that quantitative simulations of thermalization for\nnonabelian gauge theories require quantum computing. We speculate that this\nproperty generalizes to other quantum chaotic systems."}

By initializing the system in a\nproduct state and performing quenches across a broad parameter space, we\ndiscover several stable, qualitatively distinct dynamical regimes.
