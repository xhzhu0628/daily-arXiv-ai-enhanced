While traditionally attributed to geometric vanishing gradients, we propose an information-theoretic perspective. Using ancilla-mediated coherent feedback, we demonstrate an empirical constitutive relation $ΔE \\leq ηI(S:A)$ linking work extraction to mutual information, with quantum entanglement providing a factor-of-2 advantage over classical Landauer bounds. By scaling the system size, we identify a distinct efficiency transition governed by the dimension of the Dynamical Lie Algebra. Systems with polynomial algebraic complexity exhibit sustained positive efficiency, whereas systems with exponential complexity undergo an ``efficiency collapse'' ($η\\to 0$) at $N \\approx 6$ qubits. These results suggest that the trainability boundary in variational algorithms correlates with information-theoretic limits of quantum feedback control."}

While the theoretical quantum speed-up from T_cl=2^{57.8} (classical) to T_qu = 2^{28.9} (quantum) is mathematically sound, the practical implementation overhead is so extreme that attacks remain wholly infeasible in both resource and runtime dimensions. Using Qiskit-based circuit synthesis, we derive that a 3-round Keccak quantum oracle requires: 9,600 Toffoli gates (with uncomputation for reversibility); 3,200 logical qubits (1,600 state + 1,600 auxiliary); 7.47 * 10^{13} total 2-qubit gates (full Grover search); 3.2 million physical qubits (with quantum error correction)PROHIBITIVE; 0.12 years (43 days) to 2,365+ years execution time, depending on machine assumptions. These barriers -- particularly the physical qubit requirements, circuit depth, and error accumulation -- render the quantum attack infeasible for any foreseeable quantum computer. Consequently, SHA-3 security is not threatened by quantum computers for preimage attacks. We emphasize the critical importance of hardware-aware complexity analysis in quantum cryptanalysis: the elegant asymptotic theory of Grover's Algorithm hides an engineering overhead so prohibitive that the quantum approach becomes infeasible from both resource and implementation perspectives."}

This is shown to hold in the opposite manner to which it is routinely assumed, because in fact the fidelity a state has to an ideal GKP state is only upper bounded by the stabilizer expectation values. This means that, for qubits encoded in harmonic oscillators via the GKP code, a good stabilizer expectation value does not guarantee proximity to an ideal GKP state in terms of any distance based on fidelity."}

Here, we show that a non-entangling operation can increase the Schmidt number of a quantum state only if it can generate entanglement with some non-zero probability. This is in stark contrast to the case where the parties of a quantum network are only able to control their joint state by local operations and classical communication (LOCC). There, being able to apply operations probabilistically (stochastic LOCC) does not increase the Schmidt number. Our findings show that certain non-entangling operations become entangling when selecting on specific measurement outcomes. This naturally leads us to the class of stochastically non-entangling maps, being those that cannot generate entanglement even probabilistically. Intrigued by this finding, we devise a Schmidt number for quantum channels that quantifies whether a channel can generate entanglement probabilistically. Moreover, we show that a channel is non-entangling if and only if its dual map is witness-preserving -- it takes entanglement witnesses to witnesses. Based on this finding, we derive Bell-like inequalities whose violation signals that a process generates entanglement."}

We track these resources in a subsystem of a one-dimensional qubit chain evolved by random brickwall circuits. For resource-generating gates, evolution from low-resource states exhibits a universal rise-peak-fall behavior, with the peak time scaling logarithmically with subsystem size and the resource eventually decaying as the subsystem approaches a maximally mixed state. Circuits whose gates do not create the resource but entangle neighboring qubits, give rise to a ballistic spreading of quantum resource initially confined to a region of the initial state.

We find a rich phase diagram: in one spatial dimension, charge is always easy to learn, while dipole moment can be either easy or hard. In two dimensions, we find three phases: for frequent measurements, both charge and dipole moment are easy to learn; as the measurement rate is decreased, first dipole moment and then charge become hard. In two dimensions, the low-measurement phase is an exotic critical phase with anisotropic spacetime scaling, analogous to a smectic liquid crystal."}

For pure states, the only WPS are Gaussian states, but the situation is considerably more subtle for mixed states. Here, we approach the problem using convex geometry, reducing the question to the characterization of the extreme points of the set of WPS. We give a constructive method to generate a large class of such extreme WPS, which combines the following steps: (i) we characterize the phase-invariant extreme points of the superset of Wigner-positive quasi-states (WPQS); (ii) we introduce a new quantum map, named Vertigo map, which maps extreme WPQS to extreme WPS while preserving phase invariance; (iii) we identify families of extremality-preserving maps and use them to obtain extreme WPS while relaxing phase invariance. Our construction generates all extreme WPS of low dimension, starting from a specific kind of WPS known as beam-splitter states. Our results build upon new mathematical properties of the set of WPS derived in a companion paper and unveil the remarkable structure of mixed states with non-negative Wigner functions."}

We show that this does not have to be the case: under restricted operational access, classical correlations can appear nonseparable when expressed in the formalism of quantum mechanics. If an observer is limited to a constrained set of measurements and transformations, certain classical phase-space distributions can mimic entanglement-like behaviours. Imposing positivity of the associated Hilbert space operator as a physicality requirement removes some of these representational artifacts, revealing a regime in which nonseparability is genuine but still reproducible by classical models. Only when the operational restrictions on the observer are lifted further--allowing operational tests of measurement incompatibility or other nonclassical signatures--does one obtain entanglement that can no longer be captured by any classical description. This operational hierarchy distinguishes classical artifacts, classically reproducible nonseparability, and genuine entanglement."}

However, certain stages of the quantum computing pipeline can, in fact, benefit from this noise. In this work, we exploit the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis to show that noise generically accelerates a fundamental task in quantum computing -- the preparation of Gibbs states. We demonstrate this behavior using classical and quantum simulations with Haar-random and phase-flip noise, respectively, on a spin-1/2 chain with a local Hamiltonian. Our non-integrable model sees ~3.5x faster thermalization in the presence of noise, while our integrable model, which would not otherwise thermalize, reaches a thermal state due to noise. Since certifying a local Gibbs state is relatively easy on a quantum computer, our approach provides a new practical solution to a key problem in quantum computing. More broadly, these results establish a new paradigm in which noise can be harnessed on quantum computers, enabling practical advantages before the years of fault-tolerance."}

Its foundation is squeezed light and Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, making it an example of quantum metrology based on quantum correlations. Unlike all existing radiometric calibration methods, ours is in situ and provides both the detection efficiency and the more stringent quantum efficiency directly for the measurement frequencies of the user application. We calibrate a pair of the most efficient commercially available photodiode at 1550 nm to a system detection efficiency of (97.20 + 0.37)% using 10-dB-squeezed vacuum states. Our method has great potential for significantly higher precision and accuracy, but even with this measurement, we can clearly say that the available photodiode efficiencies for 1550 nm are unexpectedly low, too low for future gravitational wave detectors and for optical quantum computing."}

Moreover, we show an analytical relation between $G_q$-concurrence and concurrence in $2\\otimes d$ systems.

In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \\le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above.

Despite many theoretical models, decoherence remains a severe challenge and practical platforms are still rare. Here we propose the QB based on the degenerate optical parametric oscillator (DOPO), using the signal field as the energy-storage unit. We carefully separate the ergotropy into coherent and incoherent components and find that the coherent part decays roughly half as slowly as the incoherent part. More importantly, the coherent ergotropy and the average charging power reach their respective maxima at essentially the same moment, i.e., $γ_s t \\approx 10$. This coincidence defines the optimal instant to switch off the pump. Finally, coupling the QB to a two-level system (TLS) as the load, we demonstrate an efficient discharge process of the QB.

Here, we demonstrate an on-chip multimode resonator in which strong parametric modulation induces a large and tunable normal-mode splitting that enables microwave storage. When the spectral bandwidth of a short microwave pulse covers the two dressed-state absorption peaks, part of the pulse is absorbed and undergoes coherent energy exchange between the modes, producing a clear time-domain beating signal. By switching off the modulation before the beating arrives, we realize on-demand storage and retrieval, demonstrating an alternative approach to microwave photonic quantum memory. This parametric-normal-mode-splitting protocol offers a practical route toward a controllable quantum-memory mechanism in superconducting circuits."}

One limitation of the algorithm is that it requires knowledge of the number of solutions to obtain an optimal success probability, due to the oscillatory dynamics between the initial and solutions states (the ``soufflé problem''). While various methods have been proposed to solve this problem, each has their drawbacks in terms of inefficiency or sensitivity to control errors. Here, we modify Grover's algorithm to eliminate the oscillatory dynamics, such that the search proceeds as an exponential decay into the solution states. The basic idea is to convert the solution states into a reservoir by using ancilla qubits such that the initial state is nonreflectively absorbed. Trotterizing the continuous algorithm yields a quantum circuit that gives equivalent performance, which has the same quadratic quantum speedup as the original algorithm."}

Recently, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME), a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, has attracted considerable attention and has been extensively studied in systems with global symmetries. Here, we study the QME in gauge theories with massive local gauge symmetries. In the lattice Schwinger model, we demonstrate that the gauge structure of the reduced density matrix of a subsystem is entirely determined by the initial state and remain unchanged during the time evolution. We then investigate whether gauge symmetry can be dynamically restored following a symmetric quench. Analytical and numerical results show that when the Maxwell term is zero, gauge symmetry restoration fails due to the emergence of a peculiar conservation law. However, for any finite Maxwell term, subsystem gauge symmetry is restored in the thermodynamic limit. Based on these results, we systematically construct a families of initial states exhibiting the QME. We further explore the QME in the quantum link model-a truncated lattice Schwinger model, which has been realized in experiments. Moreover, we propose an experimentally accessible order parameter that correctly captures the QME. Our work demonstrates the generality of the quantum Mpemba effect even in the local gauge symmetries, and are directly relevant to ongoing quantum simulation experiments of gauge theories."}

SI: 5 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Molecular spin qudits based on lanthanide complexes offer a promising platform for quantum technologies, combining chemical tunability with multi-level encoding. However, experimental demonstrations of their envisaged capabilities remain scarce, posing the difficulty of achieving precise control over coherences between qudit states in long pulse sequences. Here, we implement in 173Yb(trensal) qudit the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a core component of numerous quantum algorithms, storing quantum information in the phases of coherences. QFT provides an ideal benchmark for coherence manipulation and an unprecedented challenge for molecular spin qudits. We address this challenge by embedding a full-refocusing protocol for spin qudits in our algorithm, mitigating inhomogeneous broadening and enabling a high-fidelity recovery of the state. Complete state tomography demostrates the performance of the algorithm, while simulations provide insight into the physical mechanisms behind inhomogeneous broadening. This work shows the feasibility of quantum logic on molecular spin qudits and highlights their potential."}

Among them, generalized coherent states (GCS), which naturally arise from the evolution of a coherent state with a nonlinear medium, exhibit useful quantum features such as Wigner negativity and metrological advantages [Phys. Rev. Res. 5, 013165 (2023)]. Because these states remain coherent to all orders, their nonclassical character cannot be revealed through standard intensity-intensity correlation measurements. Here, we demonstrate that the intensity-field correlation function alone provides a simple and experimentally accessible witness of nonclassicality. For GCSs, any deviation of this normalized correlation from unity signals nonclassical behavior. We derive analytical results for Kerr-generated states and extend the analysis to statistical mixtures of GCSs. The proposed approach enables real-time, low-complexity detection of quantum signatures in non-Gaussian states, offering a practical tool for experiments across a broad range of nonlinear regimes."}

Here we show that this gap disappears in a minimal broadcast extension of the Bell scenario. Assuming only the validity of quantum theory, we prove that for every entangled state $ρ_{AB}$ there exist local broadcasting maps and local measurements such that the resulting four--partite correlations cannot be reproduced by any broadcast network whose source is separable across the $A|B$ cut. Thus, all entangled states are broadcast nonlocal in quantum theory. In addition, we show that all (also mixed) multipartite states can be broadcast-self-tested, according to a natural operational definition."}

To bring clarity to this search, we introduce a framework that connects the structure of parametrized quantum circuits to the mathematical nature of the functions they can actually learn. Within this framework, we show how fundamental properties, like circuit depth and non-Clifford gate count, directly determine whether a model's output leads to efficient classical simulation or surrogation. We argue that this analysis uncovers common pathways to dequantization that underlie many existing simulation methods. More importantly, it reveals critical distinctions between models that are fully simulatable, those whose function space is classically tractable, and those that remain robustly quantum. This perspective provides a conceptual map of this landscape, clarifying how different models relate to classical simulability and pointing to where opportunities for quantum advantage may lie."}

In this work, we introduce a new class of quantum states, called $A_α$-graph states, which are constructed from either unweighted or weighted graphs by taking the normalised convex combination of the degree matrix $D$ and the adjacency matrix $A_G$ of a graph $G$. The constructed states are different from the standard graph states arising from stabiliser formalism. Our approach is also different from the approach used by Braunstein et al. This class of states depend on a tunable mixing parameter $α\\in (0,1]$. We first establish the conditions under which the associated operator $ρ_α^{A_G}$ is positive semidefinite and hence represents a valid quantum state. We then derive a positive partial transposition (PPT) condition for $A_α$-graph states in terms of graph parameters. This PPT condition involves only the Frobenius norm of the adjacency matrix of the graph, the degrees of the vertices and the total number of vertices. For simple graphs, we obtain the range of the parameter $α$ for which the $A_α$-graph states represent a class of entangled states. We then develop a graph-theoretic formulation of a moments-based entanglement detection criterion, focusing on the recently proposed $p_3$-PPT criterion, which relies on the second and third moments of the partial transposition. Since the estimation of these moments is experimentally accessible via randomised measurements, swap operations, and machine-learning-based protocols, our approach provides a physically relevant framework for detecting entanglement in structured quantum states derived from graphs. This work bridges graph theory and moments-based entanglement detection, offering a new perspective on the role of combinatorial structures in quantum correlations."}

Benjamin"], "title": "Error mitigation for logical circuits using decoder confidence", "comment": "16 pages (11 main, 5 appendix). 13 figures (8 main, 5 appendix)", "summary": "Fault-tolerant quantum computers use decoders to monitor for errors and find a plausible correction. A decoder may provide a decoder confidence score (DCS) to gauge its success. We adopt a swim distance DCS, computed from the shortest path between syndrome clusters. By contracting tensor networks, we compare its performance to the well-known complementary gap and find that both reliably estimate the logical error probability (LEP) in a decoding window. We explore ways to use this to mitigate the LEP in entire circuits. For shallow circuits, we just abort if any decoding window produces an exceptionally low DCS: for a distance-13 surface code, rejecting a mere 0.1% of possible DCS values improves the entire circuit's LEP by more than 5 orders of magnitude. For larger algorithms comprising up to trillions of windows, DCS-based rejection remains effective for enhancing observable estimation. Moreover, one can use DCS to assign each circuit's output a unique LEP, and use it as a basis for maximum likelihood inference. This can reduce the effects of noise by an order of magnitude at no quantum cost; methods can be combined for further improvements."}

We generalize this construction to arbitrary symmetries: for any group G of unitaries, we construct a quantum channel that maps states contained in the algebra generated by G to random purifications obtained by twirling over G. In addition to giving a surprisingly concise proof of the original random purification theorem, our result implies the existence of fermionic and bosonic Gaussian purification channels. As applications, we obtain the first tomography protocol for fermionic Gaussian states that scales optimally with the number of modes and the error, as well as an improved property test for this class of states."}
