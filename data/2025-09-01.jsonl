Any molecule can be considered a bipartite system in\nterms of electronic and nuclear halfspaces. Accordingly, the Schmidt\ndecomposition theorem can be applied to each molecular ansatz to find a much\nshorter representation in terms of Schmidt basis and to estimate the\nentanglement content through the calculation of von Neumann entropies. Although\nhere we justify that the ground BO vibronic state of any molecule may be\nregarded as an almost separable and non-entangled state, this property worsens\nwith the vibrational excitation, which increases the entanglement\nmonotonically. The interlace between electronic and nuclear wave functions for\neach vibronic state becomes even more critical for those electronic excited\nstates whose electronic wave functions change drastically with the molecular\ngeometry.

The measurement protocol developed here is broadly\napplicable to other quantum systems and provides a powerful method for\nexploring a broad range of QFPTD phenomena. With these results we open a new\nfield of experimental investigations of QFPT processes with potential future\nrelevance to quantum search algorithms, unraveling connections between\nclassical and quantum dynamics, and study of the quantum measurement problem."}

Generating cluster state using entanglement\nas resource is a key bottleneck for the adoption of MBQC. To generate cluster\nstate with charge-qubit arrrays, we provide analytical derivations and\nnumerical validations for 4-qubit cluster state. We compare our fidelities\nunder ideal (noise-free) Hamiltonian evolution and due to effect of\ndecoherence. We show incorporating energy relaxation ($T_1$) yields $>$90\\%\nfidelity while pure dephasing $T_2$ show $70\\%$ decays at fourth harmonics. We\nfurther show under noise $T_2$ decays to 50\\% within 15 time units, versus\n$>$70\\% under relaxation time units ($T_1$)--only. This decay quantify\ndegradation effect of $T_2$ on preparing cluster--state preparation is more\nthan $T_1$. We highlight the critical need for targeted error-mitigation\nstrategies in near-term MBQC implementations."}

Using properties of Brown algebras we provide\nan equivalent characterization of discussed families in both tensor and\ncommuting paradigms. In particular, we provide an equivalent formulation of\nTsirelson's conjecture (Connes' embedding problem) in terms of considered\nparadigms based on protocols which do not require measurements performed on\ninfinite-dimensional subsystems. As a result we show that there is a difference\nbetween quantum commuting and quantum tensor models for generalized unitary\ninduced channels."}
