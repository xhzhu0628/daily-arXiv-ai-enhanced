### [1] [Uncertainty Relations and Entanglement for PQ-deformed Supersymmetric Coherent States](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08023)
*Oktay K Pashaev,Aygul Kocak*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种具有双参数量子群结构的超对称扩展变形量子振荡器，涵盖了多种特殊情况的振荡器模型，并引入了超对称相干态。研究了费米子与变形玻色子的纠缠特性，并计算了超相干态的纠缠和不确定性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究目的是扩展变形量子振荡器的超对称性，探索其在量子群结构下的性质，特别是纠缠态和不确定性关系的非经典特性。

Method: 通过引入双参数（p和q）的量子群结构，构建了超对称变形量子振荡器模型，并定义了相应的超对称相干态。利用线性熵（Gram行列式）量化纠缠。

Result: 结果表明，纠缠程度依赖于参数p和q的值，最大纠缠态的并发度达到1。超相干态的不确定性关系显示出非经典特性。

Conclusion: 论文成功扩展了变形量子振荡器的超对称性，揭示了纠缠态和不确定性关系的非经典行为，为量子信息科学提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: We propose supersymmetric extension of deformed quantum oscillator with two
parameters quantum group structure. As particular cases, specified by values of
$p$ and $q$ parameters it includes symmetric and non-symmetric $q$-oscillators,
Fibonacci and Fibonacci divisors hierarchy of Golden oscillators, Tamm-Dankov
oscillator etc. By $pq$-deformed supersymmetric annihilation operator, the set
of corresponding supersymmetric coherent states is introduced. The states are
characterized by the pair of $pq$-quantum states from the Fock space or
equivalently, by the set of infinite number of qubit states. Entanglement of
fermions with $pq$-deformed bosons is characterized by the concurrence as the
linear entropy, taking form of the Gram determinant of inner products. As
shown, for two types of the reference states, the concurrence depends on values
of $p$ and $q$ parameters, and it reaches the value one for the maximally
entangled states. Entanglement of the super-coherent states and the uncertainty
relations for the coordinate and momentum in these states are calculated.
Non-classical nature of the entangled states is reflected in non-minimal
character of the uncertainty relations.

### [2] [Overcoming a challenge for Bohmian mechanics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08049)
*Hrvoje Nikolic*

Motivation: 回应Nature论文对Bohmian力学的质疑，证明其速度定义不限于相位梯度。

Method: 通过连续性方程明确构造速度。

Result: 成功克服了挑战，验证了Bohmian力学的普适性。

Conclusion: Bohmian力学的速度定义具有更广泛的适用性，不受限于相位梯度。

Abstract: Recently, Bohmian mechanics has been challenged [Nature 643, 67 (2025)] by
studying a system in which the motion of particles cannot be associated only
with the gradient of phase of the wave function. We point out that, in general,
Bohmian velocity is defined by the continuity equation, which does not always
lead to velocity depending only on the phase gradient. By constructing the
appropriate velocity explicitly, we overcome the challenge.

### [3] [Enhanced entanglement from quantum ergodicity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08067)
*Amit Vikram*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 遍历动力学可以生成比最大随机电路更高纠缠的态，适用于制备EPR态等量子信息任务。

Conclusion: 量子混沌的谱统计特性可作为量子信息任务的潜在资源，具有实际应用前景。

Abstract: The quantum chaos conjecture associates the spectral statistics of a quantum
system with abstract notions of quantum ergodicity. Such associations are taken
to be of fundamental and sometimes defining importance for quantum chaos, but
their practical relevance has been challenged by theoretical and experimental
developments. Here, in counterpoint, we show that ergodic dynamics can be
directly utilized for the preparation of quantum states with parametrically
higher entanglement than generated by maximally scrambling circuits such as
random unitaries. Our setting involves quantum systems coupled via a
"non-demolition" interaction of conserved charges. We derive an exact relation
between the evolving entanglement of an initial product state and a measure of
spectral statistics of the interacting charges in this state. This connection
is explained via a notion of Krylov vector ergodicity, tied to the ability of
quantum dynamics to generate orthonormal states over time. We consider
exploiting this phenomenon for the preparation of approximate
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) states between complex systems, a crucial
resource for tasks such as quantum teleportation. We quantitatively show that
the transfer of operators between entangled systems, which underlies the
utility of the EPR state, can be performed with parametrically larger capacity
for entanglement generated via ergodic dynamics than with maximal scrambling.
Our analysis suggests a direct application of "ergodic" spectral statistics as
a potential resource for quantum information tasks.

### [4] [A dynamic circuit for the honeycomb Floquet code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08069)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 动态电路方法在Floquet码中表现出色，显著提升性能并减少所需量子比特数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态电路方法在量子纠错码中的应用，尤其是Floquet码，以提升性能和效率。

Method: 采用动态电路方法测量稳定器，无需辅助量子比特，并与标准辅助比特电路进行对比。

Result: 动态电路提高了码的时间距离，自动消除泄漏，显著提升了阈值并降低了逻辑错误率。在物理错误率为$10^{-3}$时，估计所需量子比特数量减少了近3倍。

Conclusion: 动态电路方法在Floquet码中具有显著优势，能够高效提升量子纠错性能。

Abstract: In the typical implementation of a quantum error-correcting code, each
stabilizer is measured by entangling one or more ancilla qubits with the data
qubits and measuring the ancilla qubits to deduce the value of the stabilizer.
Recently, the dynamic circuit approach has been introduced, in which
stabilizers are measured without ancilla qubits. Here, we demonstrate that
dynamic circuits are particularly useful for the Floquet code. Our dynamic
circuit increases the timelike distance of the code, automatically removes
leakage, and both significantly increases the threshold and lowers the logical
error rate compared to the standard ancilla-based circuit. At a physical error
rate of $10^{-3}$, we estimate a nearly $3\times$ reduction in the number of
qubits required to reach a $10^{-12}$ logical error rate.

Abstract: Understanding the confinement mechanism in gauge theories and the
universality of effective string-like descriptions of gauge flux tubes remains
a fundamental challenge in modern physics. We probe string modes of motion with
dynamical matter in a digital quantum simulation of a (2+1) dimensional gauge
theory using a superconducting quantum processor with up to 144 qubits,
stretching the hardware capabilities with quantum-circuit depths comprising up
to 192 two-qubit layers. We realize the $Z_2$-Higgs model ($Z_2$HM) through an
optimized embedding into a heavy-hex superconducting qubit architecture,
directly mapping matter and gauge fields to vertex and link superconducting
qubits, respectively. Using the structure of local gauge symmetries, we
implement a comprehensive suite of error suppression, mitigation, and
correction strategies to enable real-time observation and manipulation of
electric strings connecting dynamical charges. Our results resolve a dynamical
hierarchy of longitudinal oscillations and transverse bending at the end points
of the string, which are precursors to hadronization and rotational spectra of
mesons. We further explore multi-string processes, observing the fragmentation
and recombination of strings. The experimental design supports 300,000
measurement shots per circuit, totaling 600,000 shots per time step, enabling
high-fidelity statistics. We employ extensive tensor network simulations using
the basis update and Galerkin method to predict large-scale real-time dynamics
and validate our error-aware protocols. This work establishes a milestone for
probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics via superconducting quantum simulation
and elucidates the real-time behavior of confining strings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 金属-基底界面是微波损耗的主要来源，材料分析结合量子设备性能指标可提升超导量子比特性能。

Abstract: Reducing materials and processing-induced decoherence is critical to the
development of utility-scale quantum processors based on superconducting
qubits. Here we report on the impact of two fluorine-based wet etches, which we
use to treat the silicon surface underneath the Josephson junctions (JJs) of
fixed-frequency transmon qubits made with aluminum base metallization. Using
several materials analysis techniques, we demonstrate that these surface
treatments can remove germanium residue introduced by our JJ fabrication with
no other changes to the overall process flow. These surface treatments result
in significantly improved energy relaxation times for the highest performing
process, with median $T_1=334~\mu$s, corresponding to quality factor
$Q=6.6\times10^6$. This result suggests that the metal-substrate interface
directly underneath the JJs was a major contributor to microwave loss in these
transmon qubit circuits prior to integration of these surface treatments.
Furthermore, this work illustrates how materials analysis can be used in
conjunction with quantum device performance metrics to improve performance in
superconducting qubits.

Abstract: Long-range quantum communication, distributed quantum computing, and sensing
applications require robust and reliable ways to encode transmitted quantum
information. In this context, time-bin encoding has emerged as a promising
candidate due to its resilience to mechanical and thermal perturbations,
depolarization from refractive index changes, and birefringence in fiber optic
media. Time-bin quantum bits (qubits) can be produced in various ways, and each
implementation calls for different considerations regarding design parameters,
component compatibility (optical, electrical, electro-optical), and measurement
procedures. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of experimental methods
for preparing and characterizing time-bin qubits (TBQs) for quantum
communication protocols, with an assessment of their advantages and
limitations. We discuss challenges in transmitting TBQs over optical fibers and
free-space channels, and methods to overcome them. We also analyze the
selection of key time-bin parameters and component requirements across
experiments. This leads us to explore the preparation and characterization of
time-bin entanglement and examine requirements for interference of time-bins
from separate sources. Further, we cover preparation and characterization
techniques for high-dimensional time-bin states, namely qudits, and the
generation of time-bin entangled qudit pairs. We review time-energy
entanglement and key experimental realizations. Finally, we present notable
applications of time-bin encoded quantum states, from quantum communication
protocols to photonic quantum computation. This work serves as an accessible
introduction and a comprehensive review of recent developments.

Abstract: Parity-time ($PT$)-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit non-unitary dynamical
evolution while maintaining real spectra, and offer unique approaches to
quantum sensing and entanglement generation. Here we present a method for
simulating the quantum dynamics of $PT$-symmetric systems on unitary-gate-based
quantum computers by leveraging Hermitian equivalents through similarity
transformations. We introduce two algorithms for simulating $PT$-symmetric
systems near exceptional points where eigenvalues and eigenstates coalesce. The
first is a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm and the second reduces the
classical component by using an ancilla qubit. We then use perturbation theory
to extend this method to consider the dynamics of two weakly interacting
$PT$-symmetric systems. Demonstrations on a quantum device and noisy simulators
validate the algorithm on current quantum devices, offering potential for
scalable simulations of $PT$-symmetric systems and pseudo-Hermitian operators
in quantum computation.

Abstract: Quantum computing has become increasingly practical in solving real-world
problems due to advances in hardware and algorithms. In this paper, we aim to
design and estimate quantum machine learning and hybrid quantum-classical
models in a few practical materials science tasks, i.e., predicting stacking
fault energies and solutes that can ductilize magnesium. To this end, we adopt
two different representative quantum algorithms, i.e., quantum support vector
machines (QSVM) and quantum neural networks (QNN), and adjust them to our
application scenarios. We systematically test the performance with respect to
the hyperparameters of selected ansatzes. We identify a few combinations of
hyperparameters that yield validation scores of approximately 90\% for QSVM and
hybrid QNN in both tasks. Eventually, we construct quantum models with
optimized parameters for regression and classification that predict targeted
solutes based on the elemental volumes, electronegativities, and bulk moduli of
chemical elements.

Abstract: Understanding topological features in networks is crucial for unravelling
complex phenomena across fields such as neuroscience, condensed matter, and
high-energy physics. However, identifying higher-order topological structures
-- such as $k$-cliques, fundamental building blocks of complex networks --
remains a significant challenge. Here we develop a universal programmable
photonic quantum processor that enables the encoding of arbitrary
complex-weight networks, providing a direct pathway to uncovering their
topological structures. We demonstrate how this quantum approach can identify
weighted $k$-cliques and estimate Betti numbers by leveraging the Gaussian
boson sampling algorithm's ability to preferentially select high-weight, dense
subgraphs. The unique capabilities of our programmable quantum processor allow
us to observe topological phase transitions and identify clique percolation
phenomena directly from the entropy of the sampling results. These findings
showcase how photonic quantum computing can be applied to analyse the
topological characteristics of real-world complex networks, opening new
possibilities for quantum-enhanced data analysis.

Conclusion: 研究结果为下一代超导量子电路的设计和超流二极管效应的研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Josephson tunnel junctions are essential elements of superconducting quantum
circuits. The operability of these circuits presumes a $2\pi$-periodic
sinusoidal potential of a tunnel junction, but higher-order corrections to this
Josephson potential, often referred to as "harmonics," cause deviations from
the expected circuit behavior. Two potential sources for these harmonics are
the intrinsic current-phase relationship of the Josephson junction and the
inductance of the metallic traces connecting the junction to other circuit
elements. Here, we introduce a method to distinguish the origin of the observed
harmonics using nearly-symmetric superconducting quantum interference devices
(SQUIDs). Spectroscopic measurements of level transitions in multiple devices
reveal features that cannot be explained by a standard cosine potential, but
are accurately reproduced when accounting for a second-harmonic contribution to
the model. The observed scaling of the second harmonic with Josephson-junction
size indicates that it is due almost entirely to the trace inductance. These
results inform the design of next-generation superconducting circuits for
quantum information processing and the investigation of the supercurrent diode
effect.

Result: 研究发现PQCs在化学相关问题上仍面临挑战，尤其是对经典机器学习方法简单但对量子方法非平凡的任务。

Conclusion: PQCs在量子化学问题中的应用具有潜力，但需进一步优化以克服当前限制。

Abstract: In the field of quantum machine learning (QML), parametrized quantum circuits
(PQCs) -- constructed using a combination of fixed and tunable quantum gates --
provide a promising hybrid framework for tackling complex machine learning
problems. Despite numerous proposed applications, there remains limited
exploration of datasets relevant to quantum chemistry. In this study, we
investigate the potential benefits and limitations of PQCs on two chemically
meaningful datasets: (1) the BSE49 dataset, containing bond separation energies
for 49 different classes of chemical bonds, and (2) a dataset of water
conformations, where coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wavefunctions
are predicted from lower-level electronic structure methods using the
data-driven coupled-cluster (DDCC) approach. We construct a comprehensive set
of 168 PQCs by combining 14 data encoding strategies with 12 variational
ans{\"a}tze, and evaluate their performance on circuits with 5 and 16 qubits.
Our initial analysis examines the impact of circuit structure on model
performance using state-vector simulations. We then explore how circuit depth
and training set size influence model performance. Finally, we assess the
performance of the best-performing PQCs on current quantum hardware, using both
noisy simulations ("fake" backends) and real quantum devices. Our findings
underscore the challenges of applying PQCs to chemically relevant problems that
are straightforward for classical machine learning methods but remain
non-trivial for quantum approaches.

Result: 实验显示QuPTs隐蔽性强，导致QNN准确率下降23%。

Conclusion: QuPTs对纯量子神经网络构成严重威胁，需进一步研究防御措施。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks (QNN) hold immense potential for the future of
quantum machine learning (QML). However, QNN security and robustness remain
largely unexplored. In this work, we proposed novel Trojan attacks based on the
quantum computing properties in a QNN-based binary classifier. Our proposed
Quantum Properties Trojans (QuPTs) are based on the unitary property of quantum
gates to insert noise and Hadamard gates to enable superposition to develop
Trojans and attack QNNs. We showed that the proposed QuPTs are significantly
stealthier and heavily impact the quantum circuits' performance, specifically
QNNs. The most impactful QuPT caused a deterioration of 23% accuracy of the
compromised QNN under the experimental setup. To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first work on the Trojan attack on a fully quantum neural network
independent of any hybrid classical-quantum architecture.

Abstract: The efficient preparation of scalable multipartite entanglement is a central
goal in the development of next-generation quantum devices. In this work, we
show that the so-called ``twist-and-turn" (TaT) dynamics for interacting spin
ensembles, generated by Hamiltonians with U(1)-symmetric interactions and with
a transverse field, can offer an important resource to reach this goal. For
models with sufficiently high connectivity, TaT dynamics exhibits two key
features: 1) it features both scalable squeezing at short times, as well as
quantum Fisher information with Heisenberg scaling at later times; and 2)
scalable multipartite entanglement (up to Heisenberg scaling) is reached in a
time growing only logarithmically with system size, associated with an
exponential buildup of quantum correlations. These results can be shown exactly
in the XY model with a Rabi field and infinite range interactions, and
numerically in the case of spatially decaying XY interactions, such as dipolar
interactions in two dimensions, provided that unstable spin-wave modes do not
develop for large system sizes and/or strong fields. For dipolar interactions,
the entanglement dynamics at intermediate times is completely at odds with
thermalization; and it appears to saturate the maximum speed of entanglement
buildup allowed by Lieb-Robinson bounds generalized to power-law interacting
systems.

Abstract: Gaussian measurements can not be used to witness nonlocality in Gaussian
states as well as the network nonlocality in networks of continuous-variable
(CV) systems. Thus special non-Gaussian measurements have to be utilized.
  In the present paper, we first propose a kind of nonlinear Bell-type
inequality that is applicable to quantum networks of both finite or infinite
dimensional systems. Violation of the inequality will witness the network
nonlocality. This inequality allows us to propose a method of the supremum
strategy for detecting network nonlocality in CV systems with source states
being any multipartite multi-mode Gaussian states according to the
configurations of the networks by utilizing non-Gaussian measurements based on
generalized quasiprobability functions. The nonlinear Bell-type inequalities
for CV networks, which depend solely on the generalized quasiprobability
functions of Gaussian states, are straightforward to construct and implement.
As illustrations, we propose the corresponding nonlinear Bell-type inequalities
for any chain, star, tree-shaped and cyclic networks in CV systems with source
states being $(1+1)$-mode Gaussian states. The examples show that this approach
works well for witnessing the nonlocality in networks of CV systems.
Particularly, a thorough discussion is given for the entanglement swapping
network. Our study provide a strong signature for the network nonlocality
nature of CV systems and lead to precise recipes for its experimental
verification.

Abstract: We compare the semiclassical and quantum predictions for the unitary dynamics
of a two-level atom interacting with a single-mode electromagnetic field in the
presence of parametric modulation of the atomic parameters, in the regime of
multiphoton atom-field resonances. We derive approximate analytic solutions for
the semiclassical Rabi model when the atomic transition frequency and the
atom-field coupling strength undergo harmonic external modulations. These
solutions are compared to the predictions of the quantum Rabi model, which is
solved numerically for the initial coherent state with a large average photon
number, of the order of $10^4$, in the regime of three-photon resonance. We
show that for initial times and sufficiently intense coherent state the
semiclassical dynamics agrees quite well with the quantum one, although for
large times it inevitably fails due to the lack of the collapse-revival
behavior. Furthermore, we describe how the field state is modified throughout
the evolution, presenting numeric results for the average photon number,
entropies (related to the atom-field entanglement) and other quantities that
characterize the photon number statistics of the electromagnetic field.

Conclusion: IPL的相位设计可实现独特的局域化与离域化态，为哈密顿量设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We perform a computational spectral analysis of different isospectrally
patterned lattices (IPL). Having been introduced very recently, the lattice
Hamiltonian of IPL consist of coupled cells which possess all the same set of
eigenvalues. The latter is achieved in a controllable manner by parametrizing
the cells via the phases of the involved orthogonal (or unitary)
transformations. This opens the doorway of systematically designing lattice
Hamiltonians with unique properties by choosing correspondingly varying phases
across the lattice. Here we focus on two-dimensional cells and explore
symmetric as well as asymmetric IPL w.r.t. a given center. A tunable fraction
of localized vs. delocalized eigenstates belonging to the three subdomains of
the corresponding energy bands is demonstrated and analyzed with different
measures of localization. In the asymmetric case the center of localization can
be shifted arbitrarily by shifting the underlying phase grid. Introducing a
complete phase revolution leads for low and high energies to two well-separated
branches of localized states which finally merge with increasing energy into
the branch of delocalized states. Remarkably, the localized states appear in
near-degenerate pairs and this near-degeneracy is lifted upon entering the
delocalization regime. A corresponding generalization to several phase
revolutions is provided showing a characteristic nodal pattern among the
near-degenerate eigenstates.

Method: 通过理论分析和算法设计，研究了不同范数（如混合Schatten范数和完全有界范数）的计算复杂性。

Result: 发现完全正映射在非超收缩情况下可高效计算，但在某些情况下是NP完全的；完全有界范数可多项式时间计算。

Conclusion: 线性映射的范数计算复杂性取决于其性质和参数选择，完全有界范数计算效率更高。

Abstract: We study the complexity of computing the mixed Schatten $\|\Phi\|_{q\to p}$
norms of linear maps $\Phi$ between matrix spaces. When $\Phi$ is completely
positive, we show that $\| \Phi \|_{q \to p}$ can be computed efficiently when
$q \geq p$. The regime $q \geq p$ is known as the non-hypercontractive regime
and is also known to be easy for the mixed vector norms $\ell_{q} \to \ell_{p}$
[Boyd, 1974]. However, even for entanglement-breaking completely-positive
trace-preserving maps $\Phi$, we show that computing $\| \Phi \|_{1 \to p}$ is
$\mathsf{NP}$-complete when $p>1$. Moving beyond the completely-positive case
and considering $\Phi$ to be difference of entanglement breaking
completely-positive trace-preserving maps, we prove that computing $\| \Phi
\|^+_{1 \to 1}$ is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete. In contrast, for the
completely-bounded (cb) case, we describe a polynomial-time algorithm to
compute $\|\Phi\|_{cb,1\to p}$ and $\|\Phi\|^+_{cb,1\to p}$ for any linear map
$\Phi$ and $p\geq1$.

Abstract: Modular architectures are a promising approach to scaling quantum computers
beyond the limits of monolithic designs. However, non-local communications
between different quantum processors might significantly impact overall system
performance. In this work, we investigate the role of the network
infrastructure in modular quantum computing architectures, focusing on
coherence loss due to communication constraints. We analyze the impact of
classical network latency on quantum teleportation and identify conditions
under which it becomes a bottleneck. Additionally, we study different network
topologies and assess how communication resources affect the number and
parallelization of inter-core communications. Finally, we conduct a full-stack
evaluation of the architecture under varying communication parameters,
demonstrating how these factors influence the overall system performance. The
results show that classical communication does not become a bottleneck for
systems exceeding one million qubits, given current technology assumptions,
even with modest clock frequencies and parallel wired interconnects.
Additionally, increasing quantum communication resources generally shortens
execution time, although it may introduce additional communication overhead.
The optimal number of quantum links between QCores depends on both the
algorithm being executed and the chosen inter-core topology. Our findings offer
valuable guidance for designing modular architectures, enabling scalable
quantum computing.

Abstract: Quantum speckles exhibit significantly richer behavior than their classical
counterparts due to their higher dimensionality. A simple example is the
far-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D
speckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends
in addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles.
To date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has
not been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution
of two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic
scatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the
two length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the
conventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field
is characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during
propagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a
constant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle
size along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions
from square to elliptical. The results merge quantum coherence with scattering
statistics and suggest new regimes of operation for correlation-based quantum
sensing and imaging.

Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body
quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As
time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete
time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the
differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schr\"odinger
equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization
of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of
temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test
this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state ($s$-NQS) with a
loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of
a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time
evolution using simply a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous
neural network architecture. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
parameterization is efficient in the number of parameters and the smooth neural
quantum state allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times
not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.

Abstract: We present a detailed study of an adiabatic state preparation in an effective

invert the preparation protocol to get back to the initial state. This
describes an overall cyclic evolution in state space. Using counterdiabatic

then analyze the control of Berry's phase along the adiabatic cyclic path, and

Abstract: We present and experimentally demonstrate a novel non-classical phenomenon,
bi-contextuality, observed in quantum systems prepared by two independent
sources. This discovery plays a key role in the developing framework of network
nonlocality, offering a new method for confirming the quantum nature of
measurements within a single network node. Bi-contextuality acts as a reversed
Bell scenario: while Bell scenarios involve splitting a system for independent
measurements, our approach combines systems from separate independent sources
for joint measurements. The outcomes defy classical models that assume
independence and non-contextuality. The simplest Bell scenario can be seen as a
subset of the Peres-Mermin (PM) square, and our phenomenon represents another
important subset of this framework. Moreover, bi-contextuality has notable
consequences related to the Pusey-Barrett-Rudolph (PBR) theorem, suggesting
that classical psi-ontic models must account for contextuality or the
dependence of preparations, challenging established assumptions.

Conclusion: 改进的LogQ算法在资源消耗和性能上优于QAOA，适用于工业规模问题。

Abstract: The LogQ algorithm encodes Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO)
problems with exponentially fewer qubits than the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). The advantages of conventional LogQ are
accompanied by a challenge related to the optimization of its free parameters,
which requires the usage of resource intensive evolutionary or even global
optimization algorithms. We propose a new LogQ parameterization that can be
optimized with a gradient-inspired method, which is less resource-intensive and
thus strengthens the advantage of LogQ over QAOA for large/industrial problems.
We illustrate the features of our method on an analytical model and present
larger scale numerical results on MaxCut problems.

Conclusion: 为REVB的理论和实验研究奠定了理论基础。

Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing
attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic
electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation
provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum
characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the
Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a
generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries
net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the
total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit
expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show
that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a
practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical
foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.

Conclusion: 近期错误表征方法在改进量子纠错和降低开销方面具有巨大潜力。

Abstract: Lowering the resource overhead needed to achieve fault-tolerant quantum
computation is crucial to building scalable quantum computers. We show that
adapting conventional maximum likelihood (ML) decoders to a small subset of
efficiently learnable physical error characteristics can significantly improve
the logical performance of a quantum error-correcting code. Specifically, we
leverage error information obtained from efficient characterization methods
based on Cycle Error Reconstruction (CER), which yields Pauli error rates on
the $n$ qubits of an error-correcting code. Although the total number of Pauli
error rates needed to describe a general noise process is exponentially large
in $n$, we show that only a few of the largest few Pauli error rates are needed
and that a heuristic technique can complete the Pauli error distribution for ML
decoding from this restricted dataset. Using these techniques, we demonstrate
significant performance improvements for decoding quantum codes under a variety
of physically relevant error models. For instance, with CER data that
constitute merely $1\%$ of the Pauli error rates in the system, we achieve a
$10X$ gain in performance compared to the case where decoding is based solely
on the fidelity of the underlying noise process. Our conclusions underscore the
promise of recent error characterization methods for improving quantum error
correction and lowering overheads.

Abstract: This paper considers the projection-free sparse convex optimization problem
for the vector domain and the matrix domain, which covers a large number of
important applications in machine learning and data science. For the vector
domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$, we propose two quantum algorithms
for sparse constraints that finds a $\varepsilon$-optimal solution with the
query complexity of $O(\sqrt{d}/\varepsilon)$ and $O(1/\varepsilon)$ by using
the function value oracle, reducing a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ and $O(d)$ over
the best classical algorithm, respectively, where $d$ is the dimension. For the
matrix domain $\mathcal{D} \subset \mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, we propose two
quantum algorithms for nuclear norm constraints that improve the time
complexity to $\tilde{O}(rd/\varepsilon^2)$ and
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{r}d/\varepsilon^3)$ for computing the update step, reducing at
least a factor of $O(\sqrt{d})$ over the best classical algorithm, where $r$ is
the rank of the gradient matrix. Our algorithms show quantum advantages in
projection-free sparse convex optimization problems as they outperform the
optimal classical methods in dependence on the dimension $d$.

Abstract: We present a quantum-analogous experimental demonstration of variational
quantum process tomography using an optical processor. This approach leverages
classical one-hot encoding and unitary decomposition to perform the variational
quantum algorithm on a photonic platform. We create the first benchmark for
variational quantum process tomography evaluating the performance of the
quantum-analogous experiment on the optical processor against several publicly
accessible quantum computing platforms, including IBM's 127-qubit Sherbrooke
processor, QuTech's 5-qubit Tuna-5 processor, and Quandela's 12-mode Ascella
quantum optical processor. We evaluate each method using process fidelity, cost
function convergence, and processing time per iteration for variational quantum
circuit depths of $d=3$ and $d=6$. Our results indicate that the optical
processors outperform their superconducting counterparts in terms of fidelity
and convergence behavior reaching fidelities of $0.8$ after $9$ iterations,
particularly at higher depths, where the noise of decoherence and dephasing
affect the superconducting processors significantly.
  We further investigate the influence of any additional quantum optical
effects in our platform relative to the classical one-hot encoding. From the
process fidelity results it shows that the (classical) thermal noise in the
phase-shifters dominates over other optical imperfections, such as mode
mismatch and dark counts from single-photon sources.
  The benchmarking framework and experimental results demonstrate that photonic
processors are strong contenders for near-term quantum algorithm deployment,
particularly in hybrid variational contexts. This analysis is valuable not only
for state and process tomography but also for a wide range of applications
involving variational quantum circuit based algorithms.

Abstract: Encoding a qubit in the continuous degrees of freedom of a quantum system,
such as bosonic modes, is a powerful alternative to modern quantum error
correction (QEC). Among the most prominent bosonic QEC codes, binomial codes
provide protection against loss and dephasing errors by encoding logical states
in superpositions of Fock states with binomially weighted coefficients. While
much attention has been given to their error-correcting capabilities and
integration into fault-tolerant architectures, efficient methods for generating
arbitrary binomial codewords remain scarce. In this work, we propose a novel
scheme for generating these codewords by exploiting nonlinear multiphoton
interactions between a continuous-variable bosonic mode (oscillator) and a
two-level system (spin/qubit). Our proposed scheme assumes the ability to
prepare the oscillator in an arbitrary Fock state and the qubit in an arbitrary
superposition of its basis states and access to arbitrarily high multiphoton
interactions. To enhance the experimental feasibility of our scheme, we further
demonstrate how to reduce the required order parameter of multiphoton
interactions by a factor of two for a special class of code states.

Motivation: Husimi函数和Wehrl熵在量子光学和数学物理中有广泛应用，但其统计解释仍需进一步研究，尤其是与多体量子纠缠的关系。

Method: 以N个自旋1/2粒子系统为例，利用贝叶斯定理提供Husimi函数和Wehrl熵的概率解释，避免引入辅助系统。

Result: Husimi函数和Wehrl熵的经典对应分别是N个经典陀螺的相空间概率分布函数及其熵，有助于理解经典-量子对应关系。

Conclusion: 该统计解释为Husimi函数和Wehrl熵提供了新的理解，并探讨了其在连续变量系统中的推广。

Abstract: Husimi function (Q-function) of a quantum state is the distribution function
of the density operator in the coherent state representation. It is widely used
in theoretical research, such as in quantum optics. The Wehrl entropy is the
Shannon entropy of the Husimi function, and is non-zero even for pure states.
This entropy has been extensively studied in mathematical physics. Recent
research also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and
many-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical
interpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system
of $N$ spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent
states, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive
operator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not
a set of orthonormal basis. Here, with the help of the Bayes' theorem, we
provide an alternative probabilistic interpretation for the Husimi function and
the Wehrl entropy. This interpretation is based on direct measurements of the
system, and thus does not require the introduction of an ancillary system as in
POVM theory. Moreover, under this interpretation the classical correspondences
of the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy are just phase-space probability
distribution function of $N$ classical tops, and its associated entropy,
respectively. Therefore, this explanation contributes to a better understanding
of the relationship between the Husimi function, Wehrl entropy, and
classical-quantum correspondence. The generalization of this statistical
interpretation to continuous-variable systems is also discussed.

Conclusion: 该研究为QML领域提供了更现实的威胁建模基础，支持深度防御设计。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) systems inherit vulnerabilities from classical
machine learning while introducing new attack surfaces rooted in the physical
and algorithmic layers of quantum computing. Despite a growing body of research
on individual attack vectors - ranging from adversarial poisoning and evasion
to circuit-level backdoors, side-channel leakage, and model extraction - these
threats are often analyzed in isolation, with unrealistic assumptions about
attacker capabilities and system environments. This fragmentation hampers the
development of effective, holistic defense strategies. In this work, we argue
that QML security requires more structured modeling of the attack surface,
capturing not only individual techniques but also their relationships,
prerequisites, and potential impact across the QML pipeline. We propose
adapting kill chain models, widely used in classical IT and cybersecurity, to
the quantum machine learning context. Such models allow for structured
reasoning about attacker objectives, capabilities, and possible multi-stage
attack paths - spanning reconnaissance, initial access, manipulation,
persistence, and exfiltration. Based on extensive literature analysis, we
present a detailed taxonomy of QML attack vectors mapped to corresponding
stages in a quantum-aware kill chain framework that is inspired by the MITRE
ATLAS for classical machine learning. We highlight interdependencies between
physical-level threats (like side-channel leakage and crosstalk faults), data
and algorithm manipulation (such as poisoning or circuit backdoors), and
privacy attacks (including model extraction and training data inference). This
work provides a foundation for more realistic threat modeling and proactive
security-in-depth design in the emerging field of quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Recovering properties of correlation functions is typically challenging. On
one hand, experimentally, it requires measurements with a temporal resolution
finer than the system's dynamics. On the other hand, analytical or numerical
analysis requires solving the system evolution. Here, we use recent results of
quantum metrology with continuous measurements to derive general lower bounds
on the relaxation and second-order correlation times that are both easy to
calculate and measure. These bounds are based solely on steady-state
expectation values and their derivatives with respect to a control parameter,
and can be readily extended to the autocorrelation of arbitrary observables. We
validate our method on two examples of critical quantum systems: a critical
driven-dissipative resonator, where the bound matches analytical results for
the dynamics, and the infinite-range Ising model, where only the steady state
is solvable and thus the bound provides information beyond the reach of
existing analytical approaches. Our results can be applied to experimentally
characterize ultrafast systems, and to theoretically analyze many-body models
with dynamics that are analytically or numerically hard.

Conclusion: 该方法无需初始状态知识或制备，且噪声环境下仍能保持魔法态的稳定性。

Abstract: Universal quantum computers require states with both entanglement and
non-stabilizerness, the latter property being commonly known as \textit{quantum
magic}. Here, we introduce a protocol that prepares magic steady states by
leveraging non-Hermitian dynamics, which, contrary to unitary dynamics, can
host pure-state attractors. We investigate the dissipative qubit, in which we
find the optimal parameters to prepare $|H\rangle$ and $|T\rangle$ states.
Interestingly, this approach does not require knowledge or preparation of an
initial state, since all the states of the Bloch sphere converge to these
steady states. We also consider the addition of classical noise in the
anti-hermitian part, and show that it does not necessarily hinder magic, rather
the single trajectories show concentration around the magic steady state value.

Abstract: We investigate the resilience of silicon-based spin qubits against
non-Markovian noise within the framework of quantum error correction. We
consider a realistic non-Markovian noise model that affects both the Larmor
frequency and exchange energy of qubits, allowing accurate simulations of noisy
quantum circuits. We employ numerical emulation to assess the performance of
the distance-3 rotated surface code and its XZZX variant, using a logical qubit
coherence time metric based on Ramsey-like experiments. Our numerical results
suggest that quantum error correction converts non-Markovian physical noise
into Markovian logical noise, resulting in a quartic dependence of coherence
time between physical and logical qubits. Additionally, we analyze the effects
of spatial noise correlations and sparse architectures, substantiating the
robustness of quantum error correction in silicon-based spin qubit systems.

Abstract: In recent years, various frameworks have been proposed for the study of
quantum processes with indefinite causal order. In particular, quantum circuits
with quantum control of causal order (QC-QCs) form a broad class of physical
supermaps obtained from a bottom-up construction and are believed to represent
all quantum processes physically realisable in a fixed spacetime.
Complementarily, the formalism of routed quantum circuits introduces quantum
operations constrained by "routes" to represent processes in terms of a more
fine-grained routed circuit decomposition. This decomposition, formalised using
a so-called routed graph, represents the information flow within the respective
process. However, the existence of routed circuit decompositions has only been
established for a small set of processes so far, including both certain
specific QC-QCs and more exotic processes as examples.
  In this work, we remedy this fact by connecting these two frameworks. We
prove that for any given $N$, one can use a single routed graph to
systematically obtain a routed circuit decomposition for any QC-QC with $N$
parties. We detail this construction explicitly and contrast it with other
routed circuit decompositions of QC-QCs, which we obtain from alternative
routed graphs. We conclude by pointing out how this connection can be useful to
tackle various open problems in the field of indefinite causal order,
particularly establishing circuit representations of subclasses of QC-QCs.
