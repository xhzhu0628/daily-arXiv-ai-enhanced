A key\nchallenge is to have precise control of the emitters position with respect to\nan individual plasmonic nanostructure. Here, we present room temperature strong\ncoupling between QDs and a single gold nano-bipyramid (BPs). The selection of\nthe bipyramid plasmonic nanocavity offers access to a single hotspot with a\nvery small mode volume. The localization of QDs at a single hotspot is achieved\nvia plasmon-triggered two-photon polymerization. This technique exploits the\nenhanced electric field at the BP tip to selectively polymerize a\nphotosensitive QD-containing formulation. Room-temperature scattering spectra\nof a 3-QD-BP system reveal Rabi splitting of 349.3 meV and a coupling strength\nof 175.68 meV.

We work with minimal,\nphysically motivated axioms on density and phase: locality, probability\nconservation, Euclidean invariance with a global phase symmetry, reversibility,\nand convex regularity. Within the resulting class of first order local\nHamiltonian field theories, these axioms single out the canonical Poisson\nbracket on density and phase under the Dubrovin and Novikov assumptions for\nlocal hydrodynamic brackets. Using a pointwise, gauge covariant complex change\nof variables that maps density and phase to a single complex field, we show\nthat the only convex, rotationally invariant, first derivative local functional\nof the density whose Euler Lagrange term yields a reversible completion that is\nexactly projectively linear is the Fisher functional. When its coefficient\nequals Planck constant squared divided by twice the mass, the dynamics reduce\nto the linear Schrodinger equation. For many body systems, a single local\ncomplex structure across sectors enforces the same relation species by species,\nfixing a single Planck constant. Galilean covariance appears through the\nBargmann central extension, with the usual superselection consequences.\nComparison with the Doebner and Goldin family identifies the reversible zero\ndiffusion corner with linear Schrodinger dynamics. We provide operational\nfalsifiers via residual diagnostics for the continuity and Hamilton Jacobi\nequations and report numerical minima at the Fisher scale that are invariant\nunder Galilean boosts. In this setting, quantum mechanics emerges as a\nreversible fixed point of Fisher regularised information hydrodynamics.

The method can be readily integrated into standard\ncomputational electromagnetic (CEM) solvers such as finite difference time\ndomain (FDTD) and finite element method (FEM). We numerically verify the\ncompleteness of boundary and medium assisted modes in the modified Langevin\nnoise formalism by reconstructing the imaginary part of the dyadic Greens\nfunction through modal expansion in three dimensions. This reconstruction\nenables a first principles description of atom field interaction via the multi\nmode Jaynes Cummings model in open and dissipative environments. Within the\nsingle excitation manifold, we show that the memory kernel of a two level\nsystem is determined by the imaginary part of the Greens function, implying\nthat radiative modes alone govern the relevant dynamics. The proposed framework\nthus provides a Greens function based approach for describing atomic population\nand single photon dynamics, directly compatible with Maxwell solvers.
