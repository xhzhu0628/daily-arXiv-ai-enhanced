The Hilbert spaces of quantum theory and their\ningredients, including wave functions, can then be relegated to secondary roles\nas convenient mathematical appurtenances.

In this thesis, we construct the $\nP(\\phi)_2 $ Quantum Field Theory (QFT) model on curved surfaces and show that\nit satisfies Segal's axioms (arXiv:2403.12804). An important ingredient in this\nconstruction is the use of a local regularization procedure to define the\ninteraction as a random variable with respect to the Gaussian Free Field (GFF).\nWe provide a counterexample demonstrating that spectral truncation\nregularization violates locality (arXiv:2312.15511). We then explain how\nSegal's formalism can be extended to the gluing of surfaces with slits, which\noffers a geometric interpretation of the entanglement entropy. Using this\ninterpretation, we exploit the Polyakov anomaly formula in Conformal Field\nTheory (CFT) and apply a simple renormalization procedure to define a quantity\ncorresponding to entanglement entropy within this geometric interpretation. We\nthen show that this quantity behaves like a CFT correlation function. This\nallows us to rigorously derive an entropy calculation of Cardy and Calabrese\n(arXiv:2501.19014). Finally, Segal's formalism is also related to the\nasymptotics of zeta determinants on surfaces of large genus where the genus\ntends to infinity (arXiv:2505.01586). We provide a geometric proof--independent\nof Segal's axioms--of the corresponding result using heat kernels, in addition\nto another proof based on Segal's axioms.

More the optimality\nof the measurement, the better will be the improvement in sensing the value of\nthe unknown parameter. Pertaining to the case of a two level system (qubit)\nundergoing rotation, a typical metrological task concerns the estimation of the\nangle of rotation ($\\tau$) given the information about the axis of rotation\n($\\theta,\\phi$). The method for garnering information about ($\\tau)$ is through\nmaximizing the Fisher information. In the absence of the axis-knowledge, the\noptimality of the metrological task reduces drastically. Drawing inspiration\nfrom recent works leveraging entanglement to connect closed time-like curves\nand metrology, we overcome this limitation (lack of the knowledge of the\nrotation axis) using an ancilla assisted protocol.

The quantum coherence in the initial state of the ancilla forms as\nthe resource aiding the protocol.
