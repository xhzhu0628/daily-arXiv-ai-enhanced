The quantum Mpemba effect (QME) - a phenomenon where systems\ninitially farther from equilibrium can thermalize faster - can be understood in\nterms of how rapidly a symmetry, broken by initial conditions, is dynamically\nrestored. In this work, we study the QME in a one-dimensional spin-1/2 XYZ\nmodel with power-law decaying interactions in the presence of a magnetic field.\nIn the prethermal regime generated by large field strengths, the system\ndevelops a continuous U(1) symmetry, enabling the QME to emerge. However, due\nto the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, the QME can only arise when\ninteractions are sufficiently short-ranged. This leads to an interplay between\nthe external field, interaction range, and dynamical symmetry restoration. We\nsystematically explore this interplay and analyze the dependence of the QME on\nthe effective temperature set by the initial state.

In particular, LHV\nmodels augmented with two bits of classical communication can explain the\ncorrelations of any two-qubit state. Would this still hold if communication is\nrestricted to measurement outcomes? While in certain scenarios with a finite\nnumber of inputs the answer is yes, we prove that if a model must reproduce all\nprojective measurements, then for any qubit-qudit state the answer is no. In\nfact, a qubit-qudit under projective measurements admits an LHV model with\noutcome communication if and only if it already admits an LHV model without\ncommunication.

Our results\ndetail the scaling of mutual information with subsystem volume, boundary area,\nand separation between spatial regions at finite temperature. Moreover, we\nquantify the total effect of non-Gaussian correlations using an\ninformation-theoretic measure - relative entropy. Our presented approach is\ndata-driven, model agnostic, and readily applicable to other platforms and\nobservables, thus constituting a universal toolkit for probing information in\nhigh-dimensional quantum systems and its role in shaping quantum matter and\nspacetime."}

Hegade", "Qi Zhang"], "title": "Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Feature Extraction", "comment": null, "summary": "We introduce a Hamiltonian-based quantum feature extraction method that\ngenerates complex features via the dynamics of $k$-local many-body spins\nHamiltonians, enhancing machine learning performance. Classical feature vectors\nare embedded into spin-glass Hamiltonians, where both single-variable\ncontributions and higher-order correlations are represented through many-body\ninteractions. By evolving the system under suitable quantum dynamics on IBM\ndigital quantum processors with 156 qubits, the data are mapped into a\nhigher-dimensional feature space via expectation values of low- and\nhigher-order observables. This allows us to capture statistical dependencies\nthat are difficult to access with standard classical methods. We assess the\napproach on high-dimensional, real-world datasets, including molecular toxicity\nclassification and image recognition, and analyze feature importance to show\nthat quantum-extracted features complement and, in many cases, surpass\nclassical ones. The results suggest that combining quantum and classical\nfeature extraction can provide consistent improvements across diverse machine\nlearning tasks, indicating a reliable level of early quantum usefulness for\nnear-term quantum devices in data-driven applications."}
