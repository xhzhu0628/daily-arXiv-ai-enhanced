In this\nwork, we introduce a novel artificial intelligence-driven protocol for quantum\ncircuit design, benchmarked using shadow tomography for efficient quantum state\nreadout. Inspired by techniques from natural language processing (NLP), our\napproach first selects a compact gate dictionary by optimizing the entangling\npower of two-qubit gates. We identify the iSWAP gate as a key element that\nsignificantly enhances sample efficiency, resulting in a minimal gate set of\n{I, SWAP, iSWAP}. Building on this, we implement a recurrent neural network\ntrained via reinforcement learning to generate high-performing quantum\ncircuits. The trained model demonstrates strong generalization ability,\ndiscovering efficient circuit architectures with low sample complexity beyond\nthe training set. Our NLP-inspired framework offers broad potential for quantum\ncomputation, including extracting properties of logical qubits in quantum error\ncorrection."}
