We analyze the unitary operator, its eigensystem, the\nsingle-qubit reduced density matrix, and the entanglement dynamics for\narbitrary initial state for any $N$. The QI in our model can be identified\nthrough key signatures such as the periodicity of entanglement dynamics and the\ntime-evolved unitary operator, and highly degenerated spectra or Poisson\nstatistics. In our previous works, these signatures were observed in the model\nfor parameters $\\tau=\\pi/4$ and $J=1,1/2$, where we provided exact analytical\nresults up to $12$ qubits and numerically for large $N$ [Phys. Rev. B\n\\textbf{110}, 064313,(2024)}; arXiv:2411.16670 (2024)}]. In this paper, we\nextend the analysis to $\\tau=m\\pi/2$, and arbitrary $J$ and $N$. We show that\nthe signatures of QI persist for the rational $J$, whereas for irrational $J$,\nthese signatures are absent for any $N$. Further, we perform spectral\nstatistics and find that for irrational $J$, as well as for rational $J$ with\nperturbations, the spacing distributions of eigenvalues follow Poisson\nstatistics. The average adjacent gap ratio is obtained as $\\langle r\n\\rangle=0.386$, consistent with Poisson statistics. Additionally, we compute\nthe ratio of eigenstate entanglement entropy to its maximum value ($\\langle S\n\\rangle /S_{Max}$) and find that it remains significantly below $1$ in the\nlimit $N\\rightarrow \\infty$, which further confirms the QI. We discuss some\npotential experimental realizations of our model."}

A successful quantum logic gate needs to\noperate on the condition that no decay event, such as spontaneous emission,\noccurs.

In this case, the wave function of qubits remains a pure state but\nis subject to additional influences from spontaneous emission, even without\nactual decay events. Therefore, such a process must be appropriately described\nby a modified version of Schr\\\"odinger equation for the dynamics conditioned on\nno-decay.

To achieve\neffective T-count reduction, it is necessary to identify equivalent circuit\ntransformation rules that are not yet utilized in existing tools. In this\npaper, we rewrite any given Clifford+T circuit using a Clifford block followed\nby a sequential Pauli-based computation, and introduce a nontrivial and\nancilla-free equivalent transformation rule, the multi-product commutation\nrelation (MCR). This rule constructs gate sequences based on specific\ncommutation properties among multi-Pauli operators, yielding seemingly\nnon-commutative instances that can be commuted. To evaluate whether existing\ncompilers account for this commutation rule, we create a benchmark circuit\ndataset using quantum circuit unoptimization. This technique intentionally adds\nredundancy to the circuit while keeping its equivalence. By leveraging the\nknown structure of the original circuit before unoptimization, this method\nenables a quantitative evaluation of compiler performance by measuring how\nclosely the optimized circuit matches the original one. Our numerical\nexperiments reveal that the transformation rule based on MCR is not yet\nincorporated into current compilers.
