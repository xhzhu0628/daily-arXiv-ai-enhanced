### [1] [SymTFT Approach for Mixed States with Non-Invertible Symmetries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05350)
*Sakura Schafer-Nameki,Apoorv Tiwari,Alison Warman,Carolyn Zhang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种研究混合态相的一般框架，适用于强、弱对称性及非可逆对称性，基于SymTFT方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索混合态相的分类，特别是涉及非可逆对称性的情况。

Method: 通过纯化密度矩阵并在双希尔伯特空间中分类相，利用SymTFT方法。

Result: 成功分类了1+1维中的强/弱对称性相，包括SWSSB和混合SPTs。

Conclusion: 该框架为混合态相的分类提供了系统方法，适用于广泛的对称性类型。

Abstract: We develop a general framework for studying phases of mixed states with
strong and weak symmetries, including non-invertible or categorical symmetries.
The central idea is to consider a purification of the mixed state density
matrix, which lives in a doubled Hilbert space. We propose a systematic
classification of phases in this doubled Hilbert space, relying crucially on
the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach. This framework applies
not only to group symmetries but also, importantly, to non-invertible
symmetries. We illustrate the approach in 1+1d to classify phases with strong
(non-)invertible symmetries, which include strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry
breaking (SWSSB) phases and mixed strong/weak symmetry-protected topological
phases (SPTs). We also develop an approach for studying symmetries that involve
a combination of strong and weak symmetries. A noteworthy example of this has
weak non-invertible Kramers-Wannier duality symmetry and strong $\mathbb{Z}_2$
symmetry. The continuum description is complemented by a lattice model analysis
informed by the SymTFT framework.

### [2] [Looking elsewhere: improving variational Monte Carlo gradients by importance sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05352)
*Antoine Misery,Luca Gravina,Alessandro Santini,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种自适应重要性采样策略，用于解决神经网络量子态（NQS）在变分蒙特卡洛（VMC）训练中的高方差梯度估计问题，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子化学中的尖锐波函数等高方差场景会阻碍变分优化的有效性，需要一种高效且无额外超参数的方法来改进梯度估计。

Method: 采用自适应调谐的重要性采样策略，专注于优化梯度估计而非损失函数，同时避免引入额外超参数并保持计算低成本。

Result: 在多种哈密顿量的基态搜索中验证了方法的有效性，包括受挫自旋系统和量子化学问题，计算成本最高可降低100倍。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了VMC的训练效率，尤其在处理高方差波函数时表现出色。

Abstract: Neural-network quantum states (NQS) offer a powerful and expressive ansatz
for representing quantum many-body wave functions. However, their training via
Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) methods remains challenging. It is well known
that some scenarios - such as sharply peaked wave functions emerging in quantum
chemistry - lead to high-variance gradient estimators hindering the
effectiveness of variational optimizations. In this work we investigate a
systematic strategy to tackle those sampling issues by means of adaptively
tuned importance sampling. Our approach is explicitly designed to (i) target
the gradient estimator instead of the loss function, (ii) not introduce
additional hyperparameters and (iii) be computationally inexpensive. We
benchmarked our approach across the ground-state search of a wide variety of
hamiltonians, including frustrated spin systems and ab-initio quantum
chemistry. We also show systematic improvements on the infidelity minimization
in the context of neural projected quantum dynamics. Overall, our approach can
reduce the computational cost of vanilla VMC considerably, up to a factor of
100x when targeting highly peaked quantum chemistry wavefunctions.

### [3] [Unified Framework for Quantum Code Embedding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05361)
*Andrew C. Yuan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个统一框架，确保修改后的CSS码与原码逻辑量子位同构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在修改CSS码时保持逻辑量子位的同构性，适用于高维量子LDPC码嵌入或权重优化。

Method: 利用同调代数语言构建统一框架，分析条件。

Result: 证明了框架的普适性，并展示了先前工作如何融入该框架。

Conclusion: 为CSS码的修改提供了理论保证，统一了现有研究。

Abstract: Given a Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) code, it is sometimes necessary to
modify the stabilizer code by adding an arbitrary number of physical qubits and
parity checks. Motivations may include embedding a high-dimensional quantum
low-density parity check (LDPC) code into finite-dimensional Euclidean space,
or reducing the weights of an arbitrary CSS code. During this embedding, it is
essential that the modified CSS code possesses an isomorphic set of logical
qubits as the original CSS code. However, despite numerous explicit
constructions, the conditions of when such a property holds true is not known
in general. Therefore, using the language of homological algebra, we provide a
unified framework that guarantees a natural isomorphism between the output and
input codes. In particular, we explicitly show how previous works fit into our
framework.

Result: 成功验证了方法的有效性，为生物医学成像和纳米级传感应用铺平道路。

Conclusion: 该方法为纳米金刚石在复杂环境中的高级应用提供了关键技术支持。

Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds have emerged as a promising
quantum sensing platform for biomedical imaging applications, yet random
orientations of individual particles present significant challenges in
large-scale sensor calibration. In this study, we demonstrate a novel approach
to simultaneously determine each particle's crystallographic axes and the
surrounding local vector magnetic field. Specifically, a minimum of four
distinct bias fields is required to unambiguously extract both the orientation
and the local field. We validate our method experimentally using NV centers in
two scenarios: (1) in a bulk diamond with known crystal orientation as a proof
of concept, and (2) on various single nanodiamonds to mimic real-world
applications. Our work represents a crucial step towards unlocking the full
potential of nanodiamonds for advanced applications such as in-situ biomedical
imaging and nanoscale sensing in complex environments.

### [5] [Solving Large-Scale Vehicle Routing Problems with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Decomposition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05373)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种两级分解策略，用于用量子近似优化算法解决车辆路径问题（VRP），显著降低了电路深度、量子比特数和双量子比特门数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统量子模拟器难以处理的复杂VRP问题，探索量子计算的潜在实用性。

Method: 采用问题级分解将VRP划分为更小的TSP实例，再通过电路级分解进一步切割，以适应近期量子设备。

Result: 电路深度减少95%，量子比特数减少96%，双量子比特门数减少99.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了解决复杂VRP的可行性，并提供了量子计算实用性的早期证据。

Abstract: We present a two-level decomposition strategy for solving the Vehicle Routing
Problem (VRP) using the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm. A
Problem-Level Decomposition partitions a 13-node (156-qubit) VRP into smaller
Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) instances. Each TSP is then further cut via
Circuit-Level Decomposition, enabling execution on near-term quantum devices.
Our approach achieves up to 95\% reductions in the circuit depth, 96\%
reduction in the number of qubits and a 99.5\% reduction in the number of
2-qubit gates. We demonstrate this hybrid algorithm on the standard edge
encoding of the VRP as well as a novel amplitude encoding. These results
demonstrate the feasibility of solving VRPs previously too complex for quantum
simulators and provide early evidence of potential quantum utility.

### [6] [Engineering giant transmon molecules as mediators of conditional two-photon gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05377)
*Tomás Levy-Yeyati,Tomás Ramos,Alejandro González-Tudela*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 利用非局域耦合的transmon分子阵列实现波导光子的被动光子控制门。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索巨型原子（非局域耦合的人工原子）在控制和操纵光与物质中的作用，为微波光子量子计算设备提供新方法。

Method: 通过非局域相互作用和分子结合强度的调控，结合transmon阵列的非线性，实现方向依赖的耦合，产生条件弹性相位偏移。

Result: 在特定条件下获得最大π相位偏移（CZ门），并分析了门保真度与实验参数的关系。

Conclusion: 巨型原子可作为微波光子量子计算设备的关键元件。

Abstract: Artificial atoms non-locally coupled to waveguides -- the so-called giant
atoms -- offer new opportunities for the control of light and matter. In this
work, we show how to use an array of non-locally coupled transmon "molecules"
to engineer a passive photonic controlled gate for waveguide photons. In
particular, we show that a conditional elastic phase shift between
counter-propagating photons arises from the interplay between
direction-dependent couplings, engineered through an interplay of non local
interactions and molecular binding strength; and the nonlinearity of the
transmon array. We analyze the conditions under which a maximal $\pi$-phase
shift -- and hence a CZ gate -- is obtained, and characterize the gate fidelity
as a function of key experimental parameters, including finite transmon
nonlinearities, emitter spectral inhomogeneities, and limited cooperativity.
Our work opens the use of giant atoms as key elements of microwave photonic
quantum computing devices.

### [7] [Probing Defects with Quantum Simulator Snapshots](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05379)
*Abhijat Sarma,Nayan Myerson-Jain,Roger G. Melko,Cenke Xu*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出一种利用量子模拟器中的快照数据探测缺陷物理的简单协议，无需显式引入缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统快照数据仅用于探测局部物理，而本研究旨在扩展其用途，以探测缺陷物理。

Method: 基于体系统的快照数据，通过分析局部自旋构型，提取缺陷熵并访问缺陷共形场理论的固定点。

Result: 成功从1d Rydberg原子实现的量子Ising临界性快照中提取缺陷熵，并访问了缺陷共形场理论的连续固定点线。

Conclusion: 该协议为实验探测缺陷物理提供了新途径，且同一数据集可用于研究多种缺陷物理。

Abstract: Snapshots, i.e. projective measurements of local degrees of freedom, are the
most standard data taken in experiments on quantum simulators. Snapshots are
usually used to probe local physics. In this work we propose a simple protocol
to experimentally probe physics of defects with these snapshots. Our protocol
relies only on snapshots from the bulk system, without introducing the defect
explicitly; as such, the physics of different kinds of defects can be probed
using the same dataset. In particular, we demonstrate that with snapshots of
local spin configurations of, for example, the $1d$ Rydberg atom realization of
the quantum Ising criticality, we can (1) extract the ``defect entropy", and
(2) access the continuous line of fixed points of effective defect conformal
field theory, which was recently discussed in the context of the
``weak-measurement altered criticality".

### [8] [Asymptotically Good Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05392)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Constructing quantum codes with good parameters and useful transversal gates
is a central problem in quantum error correction. In this paper, we continue
our work in arXiv:2502.01864 and construct the first family of asymptotically
good quantum codes (over qubits) supporting transversally addressable
non-Clifford gates. More precisely, given any three logical qubits across one,
two, or three codeblocks, the logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate can be executed on
those three logical qubits via a depth-one physical circuit of $\mathsf{CCZ}$
gates. This construction is based on the transitive, iso-orthogonal algebraic
geometry codes constructed by Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). This
improves upon our construction from arXiv:2502.01864, which also supports
transversally addressable $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates and has inverse-polylogarithmic
rate and relative distance.

### [9] [Curvature-Induced Nonclassicality in a Generalized Jaynes-Cummings Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05407)
*Somayeh Kourkinejat,Ali Mahdifar,Ehsan Amooghorban*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究空间曲率对Jaynes-Cummings模型中非经典特性的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索空间曲率如何影响量子系统的非经典特性，如Mandel参数、熵和Wigner分布函数。

Method: 使用广义相对论的类比模型，将腔内的场表示为圆形排列的振荡器，研究两能级原子与弯曲空间谐振荡器的相互作用。

Result: 空间曲率在控制非经典特性中起关键作用。

Conclusion: 空间曲率对量子系统的非经典特性有显著影响。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the influence of spatial curvature on the
Jaynes-Cummings model. We employ an analog model of general relativity,
representing the field inside a cavity using oscillators arranged in a circle
instead of a straight line, where increasing curvature corresponds to a smaller
circle radius. We investigate the nonclassical features of this quantum system
arising from the interaction between a two-level atom and a deformed harmonic
oscillator on a circle, which serves as curved-space counterpart to the flat
oscillator. We analyze the time evolution of atom-field states and, based on
this dynamic, examine how spatial curvature influences the Mandel parameter,
entropy, and the behavior of the Wigner distribution function. Our results
demonstrate that the spatial curvature plays critical roles in controlling
these nonclassical properties.

### [10] [Accessible Quantum Gates on Classical Stabilizer Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05408)
*Victor Barizien,Hugo Jacinto,Nicolas Sangouard*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了在强噪声偏置的物理量子比特上，如何高效实现量子门操作，特别是针对单主导错误类型的纠错码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着物理量子比特表现出强噪声偏置，研究如何在针对单主导错误类型的纠错码上高效实现量子门操作变得尤为重要。

Method: 通过分析$[n,k,d]$-经典稳定子码（针对比特翻转错误），证明了实现通用逻辑门集所需的操作必须通过复杂的酉电路实现。

Result: 实现电路需要满足特定条件，如$c^{h-1}r^h \geq d$或$hr\geq d$，这些约束也适用于其他纠错码。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在偏置噪声稳定子码框架下，需要进一步探索替代逻辑门构造方法（如魔法态蒸馏和培养）。

Abstract: With the advent of physical qubits exhibiting strong noise bias, it becomes
increasingly relevant to identify which quantum gates can be efficiently
implemented on error-correcting codes designed to address a single dominant
error type. Here, we consider $[n,k,d]$-classical stabilizer codes addressing
bit-flip errors where $n$, $k$ and $d$ are the numbers of physical and logical
qubits, and the code distance respectively. We prove that operations essential
for achieving a universal logical gate set necessarily require complex unitary
circuits to be implemented. Specifically, these implementation circuits either
consists of $h$ layers of $r$-transversal operations on $c$ codeblocks such
that $c^{h-1}r^h \geq d$ or of $h$ gates, each operating on at most $r$
physical qubits on the same codeblock, such that $hr\geq d$. Similar
constraints apply not only to classical codes designed to correct phase-flip
errors, but also to quantum stabilizer codes tailored to biased noise. This
motivates a closer examination of alternative logical gate constructions using
eg.~magic state distillation and cultivation within the framework of
biased-noise stabilizer codes.

Result: 证明了概念格是唯一最小的电路，对所有具有相同连通性的电路存在态射。

Conclusion: 该研究对量子因果性，特别是酉变换的因果分解具有重要意义，并构造了对偶陈述的电路。

Abstract: We take an order-theoretic approach to circuit (string diagram) syntax,
treating a circuit as a partial order with additional input-output structure.
We define morphisms between circuits and prove a factorisation theorem showing
that these can, in the finite case, be regarded as formalising a notion of
syntactical circuit rewrites, with quotient maps in particular corresponding to
gate composition. We then consider the connectivity of a circuit, expressed as
a binary relation between its inputs and outputs, and characterise the concept
lattice from formal concept analysis as the unique smallest circuit that admits
morphisms from all other circuits with the same connectivity. This has
significance for quantum causality, particularly to the study of causal
decompositions of unitary transformations. We close by constructing the circuit
characterised by the dual statement.

### [12] [Generated multi-transparency windows, Fano resonances, and slow/fast light in an opto-magnomechanical system through magnon Squeezing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05442)
*M'bark Amghar,Mohamed Amazioug*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究探讨了混合光磁机械系统中的磁机械诱导透明、Fano共振及慢/快光现象，分析了磁子挤压对光学谱吸收和色散特性的影响。

Method: 构建了一个包含机械膜、铁磁晶体和光学腔的混合系统，通过调节微波-磁子相互作用和磁子挤压参数，分析其对光学特性的影响。

Result: 发现了磁机械诱导透明（MMIT）和磁子诱导透明（MIT）现象，并展示了Fano共振和慢/快光效应的增强。

Conclusion: 研究结果为量子信息处理技术提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of magnomechanically induced
transparency, Fano resonance, and slow/fast light phenomena within a hybrid
optomagnomechanical system. The system consists of a mechanical membrane within
a cavity and a ferrimagnetic crystal with a magnon squeezing mode that couples
directly to a microwave cavity mode through magnetic dipole interaction and
indirectly to an optical cavity through the crystal's deformation displacement.
The optical cavity is influenced by the mechanical displacement, which is
driven by magnetostrictive forces through radiation pressure. The interactions
among photon, phonons, magnons, and microwave within the cavity give rise to
optomechanically induced transparency (OMIT), magnomechanically induced
transparency (MMIT) and magnon-induced transparency (MIT). We analyze how the
presence of magnon squeezing modifies the absorption and dispersion properties
of the optical spectrum. Additionally, the emergence of Fano resonance via
photon-phonon coupling in the presence of the magnon squeezing is examined. By
tuning the microwave-magnon interactions and the magnon squeezing parameters,
we enhance slow/light effects. Our results aim to contribute to the development
of quantum information processing technologies.

### [13] [Secure Quantum Relay Networks Using Distributed Entanglement without Classical Authentication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05460)
*Asgar Hosseinnezhad,Hadi Sabri*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型量子中继网络框架，完全避免经典认证，利用预分发的纠缠图和量子关联解码实现安全通信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量子通信协议依赖经典认证，易受攻击，需避免经典信任假设。

Method: 利用预分发的纠缠图和量子关联解码，确保只有指定节点能获取消息。

Result: 协议在多路径和异步纠缠分发下仍保证量子前向安全性和端到端完整性。

Conclusion: 该架构为可扩展量子通信系统奠定了基础，完全用物理量子态替代经典认证。

Abstract: Current quantum communication protocols rely heavily on classical
authentication for message origin verification, leaving them vulnerable to
evolving attacks that exploit classical trust assumptions. In this work, we
propose a novel framework for secure quantum relay networks that completely
avoids classical authentication. Instead, we leverage pre-distributed
entanglement graphs and non-classical correlation-assisted decoding to enable
exclusive message retrieval by designated nodes without broadcasting any key or
handshake. The system routes messages across multiple relay nodes, yet ensures
that no intermediate node can access the message unless it possesses the
entangled state partner. We demonstrate that even in multi-path scenarios with
asynchronous entanglement distribution, the protocol guarantees quantum-forward
secrecy and end-to-end origin integrity without trusted intermediaries.
Simulation results confirm both functionality and robustness under entanglement
loss and imperfect detection. This architecture paves the way for scalable
quantum communication systems where physical quantum states replace classical
authentication mechanisms entirely.

### [14] [Hybrid Quantum Cryptosystems: Integration of Entanglement-Assisted Decryption and Physical Phase Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05464)

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合加密框架，结合纠缠辅助解密和相位物理混淆，提升量子通信的安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子协议依赖显式传输解密密钥或相位参数，易受窃听攻击。

Method: 采用两阶段加密-解密机制：随机相位调制和电磁屏蔽保护量子信号；利用纠缠量子态解密，避免经典密钥传输。

Result: 系统在动态屏蔽和传输噪声下保持94%以上的量子相干性和0.86的纠缠负性。

Conclusion: 该架构适用于大规模安全量子网络，能有效抵御经典和量子威胁。

Abstract: This study introduces a hybrid cryptographic framework for quantum
communication that integrates entanglement-assisted decryption with phase-based
physical obfuscation. While conventional quantum protocols often rely on
explicit transmission of decryption keys or phase parameters, such models
expose critical vulnerabilities to eavesdropping. To address this challenge, we
propose a two-stage encryption-decryption mechanism. The first stage employs
randomized phase modulation protected by active electromagnetic shielding to
conceal the quantum signal from unauthorized interception. The second stage
enables legitimate receivers to retrieve encrypted phase data using entangled
quantum states, eliminating the need for classical key transfer. A formal
mathematical framework is developed to describe the two-stage encoding and
decryption process, including phase-modulated entangled states and their
transformation under nonlocal correlation and adversarial noise. Simulation
metrics confirm that the hybrid system preserves quantum coherence with
visibility above 94% and entanglement negativity of 0.86, even under dynamic
shielding and transmission noise. Simulation results demonstrate that the
combined protocol enhances anti-eavesdropping resilience while maintaining
quantum coherence. This architecture is suitable for large-scale secure quantum
networks, where multi-layered defense strategies are essential against
classical and quantum threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子测量存在固有噪声，影响纠缠检测的可靠性并限制量子技术的可扩展性。现有纠错方法资源开销大，亟需更高效的解决方案。

Method: 使用支持向量机（SVM）从Pauli测量中提取特征，开发了一种鲁棒最优纠缠见证（ROEW），并通过优化SVM参数以应对最坏情况误差。

Result: 数值实验表明，ROEW在测量误差超过10%时仍能以高保真度检测纠缠，且所需测量次数最少。

Conclusion: 该研究结合机器学习与量子信息科学，为噪声鲁棒的量子表征提供了实用工具，推动了纠缠技术在实际应用中的可行性。

Abstract: Quantum measurements are inherently noisy, hindering reliable entanglement
detection and limiting the scalability of quantum technologies. While error
mitigation and correction strategies exist, they often impose prohibitive
resource overheads. Here, we introduce a machine-learning-based approach to
achieve noise-resilient entanglement classification even with imperfect
measurements. Using support vector machines (SVMs) trained on features
extracted from Pauli measurements, we develop a robust optimal entanglement
witness (ROEW) that remains effective under unknown measurement noise. By
optimizing SVM parameters against worst-case errors, our protocol significantly
outperforms conventional methods in classification accuracy.
  Numerical experiments demonstrate that ROEW achieves high-fidelity
entanglement detection with minimal measurements, even when measurement errors
exceed 10\%. This work bridges machine learning and quantum information
science, offering a practical tool for noise-robust quantum characterization
and advancing the feasibility of entanglement-based technologies in real-world
settings.

Abstract: Electron--molecule collisions play a central role in both natural processes
and modern technological applications, particularly in plasma processing.
Conventional computational strategies such as the R-matrix method have been
widely adopted yet encounter significant scaling challenges in treating more
complex systems. In this work we present a quantum computational approach that
utilises the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) and variations thereof to
overcome these limitations. We explore a number of methods, including the use
of number projection operators and simultaneous optimisation. We demonstrate
the feasibility of our method on a model problem of electron scattering from
the hydrogen molecule. We recover the full spectrum of the Hamiltonian within a
chosen symmetry sector. Moreover, the optimal circuit parameters directly
encode the R-matrix boundary amplitudes needed for subsequent scattering
computations.

Conclusion: 李子代数工程为抗梯度消失的变分量子算法提供了可扩展的解决方案，适用于近期量子处理器。

Abstract: We propose SUN-VQC, a variational-circuit architecture whose elementary
layers are single exponentials of a symmetry-restricted Lie subgroup,
$\mathrm{SU}(2^{k}) \subset \mathrm{SU}(2^{n})$ with $k \ll n$. Confining the
evolution to this compact subspace reduces the dynamical Lie-algebra dimension
from $\mathcal{O}(4^{n})$ to $\mathcal{O}(4^{k})$, ensuring only polynomial
suppression of gradient variance and circumventing barren plateaus that plague
hardware-efficient ans\"atze. Exact, hardware-compatible gradients are obtained
using a generalized parameter-shift rule, avoiding ancillary qubits and
finite-difference bias. Numerical experiments on quantum auto-encoding and
classification show that SUN-VQCs sustain order-of-magnitude larger gradient
signals, converge 2--3$\times$ faster, and reach higher final fidelities than
depth-matched Pauli-rotation or hardware-efficient circuits. These results
demonstrate that Lie-subalgebra engineering provides a principled, scalable
route to barren-plateau-resilient VQAs compatible with near-term quantum
processors.

information. However, implementing ideal photon-number-resolving (PNR)
detectors remains experimentally challenging. Multiplexed PNR detection offers
a scalable and practical alternative by distributing photons across multiple
modes and detecting their presence using simple ON-OFF detectors, thereby
enabling approximate photon-number resolution. In this work, we establish a
theoretical model for such detectors and prove that the estimation error in
terms of photon number moments decreases inverse proportionally to the number
of detectors. Thanks to the enhanced PNR capability, multiplexed PNR detector
provides an advantage in cat-state breeding protocols. Assuming a two-photon
subtraction case, 7dB of squeezing, and an array of 20 detectors of efficiency
95%, our calculation predicts fidelity ~ 0.88 with a success probability ~
3.8%, representing orders-of-magnitude improvement over previous works. Similar
enhancement also extends to cat-state generation with the generalized photon
number subtraction. With experimentally feasible parameters, our results
suggest that megahertz-rate cat-state generation is achievable using an on-chip
array of tens of ON-OFF detectors.

semiclassical approximations, we demonstrate that the long-time average of the
QFI reveals universal behavior that persists across different systems.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来方法开发提供了基准，解决了多个长期存在的挑战。

Abstract: The polaron problem is a very old problem in condensed matter physics that
dates back to the thirties, but still remain largely unsolved today, especially
when electron-electron interaction is taken into consideration. The presence of
both electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the problem
invalidates most existing numerical methods, either computationally too
expensive or simply intractable. The continuous time quantum Monte Carlo
(CTQMC) methods could tackle this problem, but are only effective in the
imaginary-time axis. In this work we present a method based on tensor network
and the path integral formalism to solve polaron impurity problems. As both the
electron and phonon baths can be integrated out via the Feynman-Vernon
influence functional in the path integral formalism, our method is free of bath
discretization error. It can also flexibly work on the imaginary, Keldysh, and
the L-shaped Kadanoff contour. In addition, our method can naturally resolve
several long-existing challenges: (i) non-diagonal hybridization function; (ii)
measuring multi-time correlations beyond the single particle Green's functions.
We demonstrate the effectiveness and accuracy of our method with extensive
numerical examples against analytic solutions, exact diagonalization and CTQMC.
We also perform full-fledged real-time calculations that have never been done
before to our knowledge, which could be a benchmarking baseline for future
method developments.

Conclusion: 噪声消除反馈协议在量子态制备和稳定任务中表现出高效性，为量子控制提供了新工具。

Abstract: Time-continuous quantum measurement allows for the tracking of a quantum
system in real time via sequences of short, and individually weak, measurement
intervals. Such measurements are necessarily invasive, imparting backaction to
the system, and allowing the observer to update their state estimate based on
stochastic measurement outcomes. Feedback control then involves real-time
interventions by an observer, conditioned on the time-continuous measurement
signal that they receive. We here consider diffusive quantum trajectories, and
focus on the "noise-canceling" subset of feedback protocols that aim to
minimize the degree of stochasticity in the dynamics. We derive such a class of
feedback operations, showing that under the idealized assumptions of pure
states, unit measurement efficiency, and zero time-delay in implementing
feedback operations, perfectly noise-canceling feedback always exists. We
consider the resulting noise-canceled dynamics generated by an effective
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian; while non-Hermitian Hamiltonians from continuous
monitoring generally describe rare dynamics (accessible by costly
post-selection), the use of noise-canceling feedback here leads to
non-Hermitian dynamics that occur deterministically. We demonstrate this via
examples of entangled state preparation and stabilization. We then illustrate
the potential for the application of noise-cancellation to boost success rates
in magic state distillation protocols. We show that adding feedback based on
noise-cancellation into a time-continuous 5-to-1 distillation protocol leads to
higher probabilities of successful distillation across a range of input errors,
and extends the threshold on input errors for which the protocol is effective.
Our results highlight the efficacy of noise-canceling feedback-aided protocols
for quantum state preparation and stabilization tasks.

Conclusion: 量子电路为图神经网络提供了一种高效且参数少的解决方案，尤其在几何结构显著时表现优异。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.

Conclusion: 为量子拉丁方的基数分布提供了完整的理论支持。

Abstract: A quantum Latin square of order $n$ (denoted as QLS$(n)$) is an $n\times n$
array whose entries are unit column vectors from the $n$-dimensional Hilbert
space $\mathcal{H}_n$, such that each row and column forms an orthonormal
basis. Two unit vectors $|u\rangle, |v\rangle\in \mathcal{H}_n$ are regarded as
identical if there exists a real number $\theta$ such that
$|u\rangle=e^{i\theta}|v\rangle$; otherwise, they are considered distinct. The
cardinality $c$ of a QLS$(n)$ is the number of distinct vectors in the array.
In this paper, we use sub-QLS$(4)$s to prove that for any integer $m\geq 2$ and
any integer $c\in [4m,16m^2]\setminus \{4m+1\}$, there is a QLS$(4m)$ with
cardinality $c$.

Abstract: The multimode cavity optomechanical system offers versatile applications
including state transduction, coherent interconnection, and many-body
simulations. In this study, we developed a cavity electromechanical system that
integrates a 3C-SiC membrane and a rectangular superconducting cavity to
observe the generation of nearly degenerate pairs of mechanical modes.
Subsequently, we derive the expression for intrinsic frequency under nonuniform
stress and find that this method supports a remarkably resolution for stress
analysis in thin films. Experimentally, we perform collective fitting on the
measured set of 57 mechanical modes, revealing deviations in biaxial
non-uniform stress on the order of MPa. These degeneracy-broken mechanical
modes exhibit exceptional quality factors as high as $10^8$ in a thermal bath
of 10 mK. Furthermore, Allan deviation indicates that these modes exhibit
extremely stable frequencies compared with different types of optomechanical
devices. We then performed state-swapping between near-degenerate mode pairs,
demonstrating the transfer efficiency exceeding 78\%, attributed to their
exceptionally long lifetimes. This study paves the way for the design of
compact quantum phononic devices featuring high-quality-factor mechanical
multimode.

Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems possess exotic localization phenomena beyond their
Hermitian counterparts, exhibiting massive accumulation of eigenstates at the
system boundaries with different scaling behaviors. In this study, we
investigate two weakly coupled non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson chains under
M\"obius boundary conditions (MBCs), and reveal the coexistence of two distinct
localization behaviors for eigenstates. Namely, eigenstates exhibit
non-Hermitian skin effect in one chain and scale-free localization in the
other. Notably, the localization characteristics of eigenstates can exchange
between the two chains depending on their eigenenergies. This phenomenon is
found to emerge from the critical behaviors induced by the weak interchain
coupling, which can even be enhanced by MBCs in comparison \red{to} the system
under other boundary conditions. Our findings deepen the understanding of
non-Hermitian localization and criticality, and offer new insights into
engineering tunable edge-localized states in synthetic quantum systems.

Conclusion: 为量子信息中的问题提供了高效计算表征的理论基础，并部分解决了强逆指数问题。

Abstract: The fundamental goal of information theory is to characterize complex
operational tasks using efficiently computable information quantities,
Shannon's capacity formula being the prime example of this. However, many tasks
in quantum information can only be characterized by regularized entropic
measures that are often not known to be computable and for which efficient
approximations are scarce. It is thus of fundamental importance to understand
when regularization is not needed, opening the door to an efficiently
computable characterization based on additive quantities. Here, we demonstrate
that for a large class of problems, the question of whether regularization is
needed or not can be determined at the single-copy level. Specifically, we
demonstrate that regularization of the Umegaki relative entropy, along with
related quantities such as the Petz and sandwiched relative entropies, is not
needed if and only if a single-copy optimizer satisfies a certain property.
These problems include hypothesis testing with arbitrarily varying hypotheses
as well as quantum resource theories used to derive fundamental bounds for
entanglement and magic state distillation. We derive the Stein, Chernoff, and
Hoeffding exponents for these problems and establish necessary and sufficient
conditions for their additivity, while also presenting partial results for the
strong converse exponent.

Abstract: Thermal engines have been one of the principal topics of thermodynamics ever
since its beginning. Today, in the era of the second quantum revolution,
although the thermal processes in constant temperatures are relatively well
understood in the language of resource theories, a framework to describe
thermal engines is still in its infancy. In this work we formalize the resource
theory of engines, initially put forward in [Quantum 8, 1222], and define such
quantities as engine efficiency. Then, we turn to a detailed study of thermal
engines based on free operations arising from the resource theory of
athermality under different restrictions: thermal operation, semilocal thermal
operations and local thermal operation with classical communication. In order
to provide analytic lower bounds for thermal engine operation we construct
tree-states -- free states, which can be obtained from Gibbs state in simple
protocol consisting solely of two-level operations. Furthermore, we derive a
full description of the engine based on semilocal thermal operations describing
e.g. free states, faithful monotones and catalytic advantages.

Conclusion: 研究首次明确实验证明了HSE，并推动了关于封闭量子系统达到平衡机制的深入探讨。

Abstract: Ergodicity, the property that all allowed configurations are explored over
time, plays a pivotal role in explaining the equilibrium behavior of classical
dynamical systems. Yet, such a property is typically precluded in quantum
systems owing to the presence of energy eigenstates, which are stationary
states in dynamics. However, recent theoretical works have argued that ergodic
explorations of the Hilbert space, occurring at varying levels as measured by
statistical pseudorandomness of the time-evolved quantum states, may be
exhibited for quantum systems driven by Hamiltonians with aperiodic time
dependencies, which do not face such obstacles. Here, we experimentally
investigate the hierarchy of Hilbert-space ergodicities (HSE) achievable in the
dynamics of a single quantum spin realized by a solid-state defect in diamond,
upon subjecting it to various time-dependent modulations. Through continuous
monitoring of spin trajectories with full state tomography, different degrees
of HSE were observed, ranging from no HSE in a time-periodic (Floquet) drive,
to partial HSE in a smoothly kicked time-quasiperiodic drive, to complete HSE
in a drive composed of a sequence of kicks generated by the Fibonacci word. We
formulate a theoretical understanding of the increasing levels of HSE observed
by attributing them to increasing levels of complexities associated with the
drive sequences, whose notions we elucidate. Our work constitutes the first
unambiguous experimental evidence of Hilbert space ergodicity and promotes
deeper investigations into the mechanisms and fine-grained levels with which
closed quantum systems reach equilibrium.

Abstract: We report the first experimental demonstration of squeezed lasing in a
reservoir-engineered optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The OPO provides a
basis of squeezed states and parametric amplification in lasing emission, whose
vacuum reservoir is coupled to a squeezed vacuum generated by a second OPO.
With a precisely controlled squeezing angle and strong squeezing injection, the
parametric interaction in the first OPO is exponentially enhanced. It
successfully circumvents the decoherence in the system, and eliminates the
undesired noise of spontaneous photon emission in the OPO. As a result, the
amplified parametric process simultaneously reserves the coherence and quantum
properties in the first OPO, and yields a -6.1 dB squeezed laser in optical
domain with a narrow linewidth and high brightness. Our work sheds light on
potential applications of squeezed lasing in quantum metrology and quantum
optics.

Abstract: Time-reversal of unitary evolution is fundamental in quantum information
processing. Many scenarios, particularly those in quantum learning and
metrology, assume free access to the time-reverse of an unknown unitary. In
this paper, we settle the query complexity of the unitary time-reversal task:
approximately implementing $U^{-1}$ given only black-box access to an unknown
$d$-dimensional unitary $U$. We provide a tight query lower bound
$\Omega((1-\epsilon)d^2)$ for the unitary time-reversal to within diamond norm
error $\epsilon$. Notably, our lower bound applies to general coherent
protocols with unbounded ancillas, and holds even when $\epsilon$ is an
average-case distance error. Moreover, our result implies a query lower bound
$\Omega(d^2)$ for approximately implementing control-$U$ up to an irrelevant
phase, which is also tight with respect to the dimension.

Abstract: We discuss the concept of transformations among reference frames (classical
or quantum). Usually transformations among classical reference frames have
sharply defined parameters; geometrically they can be considered as pure states
in the parameters' space, and they form a group. It is however possible that
the distributions in the parameters' space are mixed state; such states form a
semigroup. Similarly, transformations among quantum reference frames can be
either pure or mixed. This gives rise to interesting consequences, in
particular, the state of a system S can be pure with respect to a reference
frame and mixed with respect to another. We argue that these nonpure
transformations are natural, and give an application to the connections of time
and (inverse) temperature for thermal states.

Abstract: Quantum noise is the fundamental limit of laser phase noise filter. We cannot

quantum-enhanced phase noise suppression is realized across the Fourier
frequencies from 5 kHz to 60 kHz. The demonstration unlocks the application of
squeezed vacuum state in laser phase noise suppression.

Abstract: Quantum state discrimination is a fundamental concept in quantum information
theory, which refers to a class of techniques to identify a specific quantum
state through a positive operator-valued measure. In this work, we investigate
how structural information about either the quantum states or the measurement
operators can influence our ability to determine or bound the optimal
discrimination probability. First, we observe that for single-qubit states,
pairwise fidelities are sufficient to completely characterize the optimal
discrimination. In contrast, for multi-qubit states, this correspondence breaks
down. Motivated by this, we analytically derive the optimal discrimination
probability for three equiprobable single-qubit states with equal pairwise
fidelities in terms of fidelity. Secondly, we consider partial information
about the optimal measurement, specifically the measurement operators that
vanish in the optimal solution. We show that such information can be leveraged
to tighten existing upper bounds on the optimal discrimination probability.
Lastly, we show that in some cases, subsets and supersets of nonvanishing
operators can be identified without semidefinite programming.

Abstract: Noise fundamentally limits the performance of quantum systems by degrading
coherence and reducing control fidelity. Characterizing this noise is essential
for improving measurement accuracy, understanding environmental interactions,
and designing effective control strategies. However, extracting its spectral
characteristics and associated dephasing times from limited experimental data
remains a key challenge.
  Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on Dynamical Mode
Decomposition (DMD) to analyze the dynamics of quantum systems under stochastic
noise. We reinterpret DMD modes as statistical weights over an ensemble of
quantum trajectories and use this mapping to construct a noise power spectral
density (PSD) via a nonlinear transformation. This enables identification of
dominant frequency contributions in both white and $1/f$ noise environments and
directly yields the pure dephasing time $T_2^*$ from DMD eigenvalues. To
overcome instability in standard DMD reconstruction, we develop a constrained
extrapolation scheme using the extracted $T_2^*$ as a physical bound and the
learned PSD as mode weights. We demonstrate our method on simulated Ramsey-type
dynamics and validate its ability to recover spectral features and coherence
decay. This approach offers a robust, data-driven tool for diagnostic and
predictive noise analysis in quantum systems.

Abstract: We operationally uncover aspects of wave/particle duality for the open driven
Jaynes-Cummings (JC) model in its strong-coupling limit. We lay special
emphasis on the vacuum Rabi resonance, and determine the corresponding
normalized intensity-field correlation function via mapping to ordinary
resonance fluorescence. We demonstrate that temporal wave-particle fluctuations
of light emanating from an established vacuum Rabi resonance are explicitly
non-classical, while the limit of vanishing spontaneous emission restores
detailed balance. When photon blockade sets in, individual realizations show a
rapidly increasing frequency of fluctuations towards the two-photon resonance,
arising as a direct consequence of a resolved JC spectrum. About the two-photon
resonance peak, spontaneous emissions are more likely to revive a
high-frequency quantum beat in the conditioned electromagnetic field amplitude
than photons escaping out of the cavity mode. The beat originates from a
coherent superposition of the first excited JC couplet states, and sets the
background against which nonclassical phase shifts are observed in the
conditioned quadrature amplitudes. We also find that the onset of steady-state
bimodality reduces the variation of the normalized intensity-field correlation,
at the expense of its temporal symmetry.

Abstract: Selective reflection is a high-resolution spectroscopic method that allows
the probing of atomic and molecular gases in the near field of dielectric cell
windows. It is a sensitive technique for measuring interactions between excited
atoms and surfaces, thus providing a unique tool to probe resonant effects in
Casimir-Polder physics. The theoretical modelling of selective reflection
spectra has thus far employed the infinite Doppler approximation which assumes
that the Doppler shift dominates over the atom-surface interactions as well as
the homogeneous transition linewidth. Here we extend the theoretical treatment
of selective reflection spectra to include the effects of finite Doppler width.
This allows us to analyse the regime of very large Casimir-Polder interactions,
relevant for Rydberg atom spectroscopy, and revisit previous analyses of
experiments with low-lying excited states. Further, this will aid in
determining the signatures of quantum friction in vapor cell spectroscopy.

Abstract: Multipartite entanglement offers a powerful framework for understanding the
complex collective phenomena in quantum many-body systems that are often beyond
the description of conventional bipartite entanglement measures. Here, we
propose a class of multipartite entanglement measures that incorporate the
matrix product state (MPS) representation, enabling the characterization of the
optimality of quantum circuits for state preparation. These measures are
defined as the minimal distances from a target state to the manifolds of MPSs
with specified virtual bond dimensions $\chi$, and thus are dubbed as
$\chi$-specified matrix product entanglement ($\chi$-MPE). We demonstrate
superlinear, linear, and sublinear scaling behaviors of $\chi$-MPE with respect
to the negative logarithmic fidelity $F$ in state preparation, which correspond
to excessive, optimal, and insufficient circuit depth $D$ for preparing
$\chi$-virtual-dimensional MPSs, respectively. Specifically, a linearly-growing
$\chi$-MPE with $F$ suggests $\mathcal{H}_{\chi} \simeq \mathcal{H}_{D}$, where
$\mathcal{H}_{\chi}$ denotes the manifold of the $\chi$-virtual-dimensional
MPSs and $\mathcal{H}_{D}$ denotes that of the states accessible by the $D$
layer circuits. We provide an exact proof that $\mathcal{H}_{\chi=2} \equiv
\mathcal{H}_{D=1}$. Our results establish tensor networks as a powerful and
general tool for developing parametrized measures of multipartite entanglement.
The matrix product form adopted in $\chi$-MPE can be readily extended to other
tensor network ans\"atze, whose scaling behaviors are expected to assess the
optimality of quantum circuit in preparing the corresponding tensor network
states.

Abstract: The most appealing features of chip-scale quantum sensors are their
capability to maintain extreme sensitivity while enabling large-scale batch
manufacturing. This necessitates high-level integration and wafer-level
fabrication of atomic vapor cells. In this paper, we describe a micromachining
paradigm for wafer-level atomic vapor cells functionalized by CMOS-compatible
non-magnetic heaters and temperature sensors and demonstrate several innovative
applications. Leveraging standard micro-nanofabrication technology, the
integrated vapor cells achieved an ultra-long optical access of 5 mm, nearly
four time that of previously microfabricated vapor cells. The feasibility of
the integrated atomic vapor cells fabrication process was verified by a
consecutive 30-day aging test in a harsh environment (operating temperature of
473 K and vacuum of approximately 1 Pa). Benefiting from the ultra-long optical
path, we observed several typical quantum effects, including the saturation
absorption and spin fluctuations, a regime previously inaccessible with
conventional micromachined vapor cells. Finally, a zero-field quantum
magnetometry with an ultra-high magnetic sensitivity of 12 fT/Hz1/2 was also
demonstrated. Our achievements broaden the potential applications of
microfabricated atomic vapor cells and pave the way for scalable manufacturing
of ultrasensitive, chip-scale quantum sensors.

Abstract: We consider the task of quantum state certification: given a description of a
hypothesis state $\sigma$ and multiple copies of an unknown state $\rho$, a
tester aims to determine whether the two states are equal or $\epsilon$-far in
trace distance. It is known that $\Theta(d/\epsilon^2)$ copies of $\rho$ are
necessary and sufficient for this task, assuming the tester can make entangled
measurements over all copies [CHW07,OW15,BOW19]. However, these bounds are for
a worst-case $\sigma$, and it is not known what the optimal copy complexity is
for this problem on an instance-by-instance basis. While such instance-optimal
bounds have previously been shown for quantum state certification when the
tester is limited to measurements unentangled across copies [CLO22,CLHL22],
they remained open when testers are unrestricted in the kind of measurements
they can perform.
  We address this open question by proving nearly instance-optimal bounds for
quantum state certification when the tester can perform fully entangled
measurements. Analogously to the unentangled setting, we show that the optimal
copy complexity for certifying $\sigma$ is given by the worst-case complexity
times the fidelity between $\sigma$ and the maximally mixed state. We prove our
lower bounds using a novel quantum analogue of the Ingster-Suslina method,
which is likely to be of independent interest. This method also allows us to
recover the $\Omega(d/\epsilon^2)$ lower bound for mixedness testing [OW15],
i.e., certification of the maximally mixed state, with a surprisingly simple
proof.

Abstract: Interferometry can be viewed generally as the measurement of a relative phase
between two subsystems. I consider the problem of interfering a quantum
resource state with a thermal bath, drawing a precise connection between the
athermality of the resource and the resulting phase sensitivity. This is done
by finding the fundamental sensing precision limit under the minimal conditions
of global unitarity and energy conservation. The results here apply both to
general finite-dimensional systems and to linear quantum optics. The same
techniques further upper-bound the speed at which a system and bath can jointly
evolve under an energy-conserving interaction.

Abstract: We present the mathematical model and numerical calculation results for the
tunneling of the wave function in a time-periodic double-well potential. The
bi-quadratic potential of a double-well form is used. Based on a mathematical
model of the time evolution of the wave function, a numerical algorithm has
been developed and a program has been created for solving the Schr\"odinger
equation, which describes the time evolution of the particle's wave function.
As a result of numerical modeling, modulation regimes have been obtained at
which tunneling took place. In a stationary double well potential, no tunneling
was observed. On the contrary, in the time periodic potential, tunneling was
observed, the rate of which depended on the modulation frequency. Adjusting the
modulation parameters, it is possible to control the particle wave function
tunneling rate.

Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum
information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of
light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and
matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating)
processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created
or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between
light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for
noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum
technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant
interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium
superradiant phase transitions.Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting
of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving
ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective
magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term.
We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz
- direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative
enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of
remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform
facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant
interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling
noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.

Abstract: Temporal correlations are fundamental in quantum physics, yet their
computation is often challenging. The regression theorem (or hypothesis) serves
as a key tool in this context, offering a seemingly straightforward approach.
However, it fails for systems strongly coupled to their surroundings, where
memory effects become significant. Here, we extend the analysis of temporal
correlations beyond the regression theorem, revealing what can be learned about
open quantum systems when this hypothesis fails. We introduce robust,
operationally meaningful methods to explore how the breakdown of the regression
hypothesis can uncover fundamental quantum features of non-Markovian open
systems, including entanglement, coherence, and quantum memory, namely, the
fundamental impossibility of simulating memory in non-Markov processes with
classical feedback mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate how these quantum
features are linked to microscopic properties such as the bath spectral density
and heat flow.

Conclusion: 该研究为量子不常见信息的计算提供了新的理论框架和实用工具。

Abstract: In classical information theory, uncommon information refers to the amount of
information that is not shared between two messages, and it admits an
operational interpretation as the minimum communication cost required to
exchange the messages. Extending this notion to the quantum setting, quantum
uncommon information is defined as the amount of quantum information necessary
to exchange two quantum states. While the value of uncommon information can be
computed exactly in the classical case, no direct method is currently known for
calculating its quantum analogue. Prior work has primarily focused on deriving
upper and lower bounds for quantum uncommon information. In this work, we
propose a new approach for estimating these bounds by utilizing the quantum
Donsker-Varadhan representation and implementing a gradient-based optimization
method. Our results suggest a pathway toward efficient approximation of quantum
uncommon information using variational techniques grounded in quantum neural
architectures.

Conclusion: 该方法为Rydberg原子阵列提供了实现蓝图，并可推广到其他QEC码，如量子低密度奇偶校验码。

Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) requires the execution of deep quantum
circuits with large numbers of physical qubits to protect information against
errors. Designing protocols that can reduce gate and space-time overheads of
QEC is therefore crucial to enable more efficient QEC in near-term experiments.
Multiqubit gates offer a natural path towards fast and low-depth stabilizer
measurement circuits. However, they typically introduce high-weight correlated
errors that can degrade the circuit-level distance, leading to slower scalings
of the logical error probabilities. In this work, we show how to realize fast
and efficient surface code stabilizer readout using only two $CZ_2$ gates --
instead of four $CZ$ -- while preserving fault tolerance, and provide a
blueprint for implementation in Rydberg atom arrays. We derive the time-optimal
pulses implementing the gates and perform extensive QEC numerical simulations
with leakage errors. Compared to the standard protocol using four $CZ$ gates,
our scheme is faster, uses fewer gates and crucially maintains fault tolerance
with comparable logical error probabilities. Fault-tolerant generalizations of
this scheme to other QEC codes, such as quantum Low-Density Parity-Check codes,
are also discussed.

Conclusion: 该结果为量子态的几何不变量分类提供了理论基础，有助于高效识别有用的量子态类。

Abstract: We establish a previously unexplored conservation law for the Quantum Fisher
Information Matrix (QFIM) expressed as follows; when the QFIM is constructed
from a set of observables closed under commutation, i.e., a Lie algebra, the
spectrum of the QFIM is invariant under unitary dynamics generated by these
same operators. Each Lie algebra therefore endows any quantum state with a
fixed "budget" of metrological sensitivity -- an intrinsic resource that we
show, like optical squeezing in interferometry, cannot be amplified by
symmetry-preserving operations. The Uhlmann curvature tensor (UCT) naturally
inherits the same symmetry group, and so quantum incompatibility is similarly
fixed. As a result, a metrological analog to Liouville's theorem appears;
statistical distances, volumes, and curvatures are invariant under the
evolution generated by the Lie algebra. We discuss this as it relates to the
quantum analogs of classical optimality criteria. This enables one to
efficiently classify useful classes of quantum states at the level of Lie
algebras through geometric invariants.

Abstract: Quadratic bosonic Hamiltonians and their associated unitary transformations
form a fundamental class of operations in quantum optics, modeling key
processes such as squeezing, displacement, and beam-splitting. Their
Heisenberg-picture dynamics simplifies to linear (or possibly affine)
transformations on quadrature operators, enabling efficient analysis and
decomposition into optical gate sets using matrix operations. However, this
formalism discards a phase, which, while often neglected, is essential for a
complete unitary characterization. We present efficient methods to recover this
phase directly from the vacuum-to-vacuum amplitude of the unitary, using
calculations that scale polynomially with the number of modes and avoid Fock
space manipulations. We reduce to integration the general problem, including
the case of time-dependent Hamiltonians, and provide analytical results for key
cases including when the Hamiltonian is positive definite, passive, active, or
single-mode.

Result: 发现缓冲模式频率选择不当会通过多光子共振显著降低Kerr-cat相干性。

Conclusion: Kerr-cat量子比特在电磁环境优化后表现稳健，需谨慎设计缓冲模式频率。

Abstract: Kerr-cat qubits have been experimentally shown to exhibit a large noise bias,
with one decay channel suppressed by several orders of magnitude. In
superconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the
nonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle,
further enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical
drive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases
to increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from
the multimode nature of the circuit implementation: specifically, the buffer
mode used to control the Kerr-cat qubit can induce multiphoton resonances that
sharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence if its frequency is not carefully chosen. We
uncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and
treating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that
incorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum. Our results not only
provide an explanation for the sudden reduction of the tunneling time but also
demonstrate the robustness of the Kerr-cat qubit when its surrounding
electromagnetic environment is carefully engineered.

Abstract: We consider the problem of simulating dynamics of classical nonlinear
dissipative systems with $N\gg 1$ degrees of freedom. To make the problem
tractable for quantum computers, we add a weak Gaussian noise to the equation
of motion and the initial state. Our main result is an end-to-end quantum
algorithm for simulating the noisy dynamics of nonlinear systems satisfying
certain sparsity and divergence-free conditions. For any constant nonzero noise
rate, the quantum runtime scales polynomially with $\log{(N)}$, evolution time,
inverse error tolerance, and the relative strength of nonlinearity and
dissipation. Our main technical tool is the Kolmogorov partial differential
equation describing time evolution of scalar functions of solutions, averaged
over noise. To enable efficient quantum simulation, we project the Kolmogorov
equation onto the space of low degree polynomials and derive a rigorous upper
bound on the resulting approximation error, which may be of independent
interest. Finally, we show that the considered simulation problem is
BQP-complete, meaning that it is as hard as simulating the universal quantum
computer. We demonstrate the efficacy of our algorithm by simulating it
numerically for two paradigmatic nonlinear systems: an anharmonic oscillator
and the 2D Navier Stokes equation.

Abstract: We present a scalable framework for accurately modeling many-body
interactions in surface-code quantum processor units (QPUs). Combining a
concise diagrammatic formalism with high-precision numerical methods, our
approach efficiently evaluates high-order, long-range Pauli string couplings
and maps complete chip layouts onto exact effective Hamiltonians. Applying this
method to surface-code architectures, such as Google's Sycamore lattice, we
identify three distinct operational regimes: computationally stable,
error-dominated, and hierarchy-inverted. Our analysis reveals that even modest
increases in residual qubit-qubit crosstalk can invert the interaction
hierarchy, driving the system from a computationally favorable phase into a
topologically ordered regime. This framework thus serves as a powerful guide
for optimizing next-generation high-fidelity surface-code hardware and provides
a pathway to investigate emergent quantum many-body phenomena.

Abstract: We construct $\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits in
circuit depth $O(\log k \log \log n k / \varepsilon)$. The depth is
exponentially improved over all known results in all three parameters $n$, $k$,
$\varepsilon$. We further show that each dependence is optimal up to
exponentially smaller factors. Our construction uses $\tilde{{O}}(nk)$ ancilla
qubits and ${O}(nk)$ bits of randomness, which are also optimal up to $\log(n
k)$ factors. An alternative construction achieves a smaller ancilla count
$\tilde{{O}}(n)$ with circuit depth ${O}(k \log \log nk/\varepsilon)$. To
achieve these efficient unitary designs, we introduce a highly-structured
random unitary ensemble that leverages long-range two-qubit gates and low-depth
implementations of random classical hash functions. We also develop a new
analytical framework for bounding errors in quantum experiments involving many
queries to random unitaries. As an illustration of this framework's
versatility, we provide a succinct alternative proof of the existence of
pseudorandom unitaries.

Abstract: In this work, we prove a one-shot random coding bound for classical-quantum
channel coding, a problem conjectured by Burnashev and Holevo in 1998. By
choosing the optimal input distribution, we recover the optimal error exponent
(i.e., the reliability function) of classical-quantum channels for rates above
the critical rate. Our result extends to various quantum packing-type problems,
including classical communication over any fully quantum channel with or
without entanglement-assistance, constant composition codes, and classical data
compression with quantum side information via fixed-length or variable-length
coding.
  Our technical ingredient is to establish an operator layer cake theorem - the
directional derivative of an operator logarithm admits an integral
representation of certain projections. This shows that a kind of pretty-good
measurement is equivalent to a randomized Holevo-Helstrom measurement, which
provides an operational explanation of why the pretty-good measurement is
pretty good.
