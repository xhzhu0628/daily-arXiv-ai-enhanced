Many NP-hard problems can be reformulated as Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO), which maps naturally onto quantum\nHamiltonians. However, the limited qubit counts of current NISQ devices\nrestrict practical deployment of such algorithms. In this study, we present the\nHamiltonian Auto-Decomposition Optimisation Framework (HADOF), which leverages\nan iterative strategy to automatically divide the Quadratic Unconstrained\nBinary Optimisation (QUBO) Hamiltonian into sub-Hamiltonians which can be\noptimised separately using Hamiltonian based optimisers such as QAOA, QA or\nSimulated Annealing (SA) and aggregated into a global solution. We compare\nHADOF with Simulated Annealing (SA) and the CPLEX exact solver, showing\nscalability to problem sizes far exceeding available qubits while maintaining\ncompetitive accuracy and runtime. Furthermore, we realise HADOF for a toy\nproblem on an IBM quantum computer, showing promise for practical applications\nof quantum optimisation."}

We identify, through both numerical and\nanalytical approaches, the criteria for realizing optical non-reciprocity\nwithin a synchronization regime.

In finite-size systems, the long-time evolution\nof boundary time crystals exhibits decaying oscillations that cannot be\ncaptured by widely used mean-field theory. To address this issue, we develop an\neffective approach called the stroboscopic rotating wave approximation, which\nprovides a well approximate state for the long-time evolution of boundary time\ncrystals under strong driving. In this approach, the order parameter exhibits\nboth a long-time decaying envelope governed by an effective Lindblad\nsuperoperator and short-time oscillations dominated by a reduced quantum\ndynamical semigroup. Our results reveal that the competition among dephasing\nprocesses along three distinct directions induces persistent oscillations,\nmarking the emergence of the boundary time crystal phase. We obtain the\nanalytical expressions for the steady-state density operator, the oscillation\nperiod, and the decay rate of the order parameter in the regime where the\ncoherent energy splitting exceeds the dissipation rate.

At the\nsame time, developments in quantum software are rapidly progressing.\nInsufficient quantum resources often are the problem when running quantum\nalgorithms. New techniques can aid in using smaller quantum computers to run\nlarger quantum algorithms. One of these techniques is circuit cutting. With\nthis method, a circuit is broken into multiple pieces, each of which is run on\nquantum hardware independently and then recombined to obtain the overall\nanswer. These circuit cutting techniques require additional circuit\nevaluations, which can form a bottleneck for algorithms requiring many\ninteractions. This work explores the potential of circuit cutting techniques\nprecisely in this regime of many interactions. We consider two different\nmodels, a standard method based on expectation values, and a novel method based\non probability distribution reconstruction. Next, we compare two different\ntraining methods we call train-then-cut and cut-then-train and show that in\npractice, cut-then-train still produces good results. This observation brings\ncloser the practical applicability of circuit cutting techniques, as a\ntrain-then-cut strategy is often infeasible.

In this work, we consider a\nvariant called cheat-penalised weak coin-flipping in which if a party gets\ncaught cheating, they lose $\\Lambda$ points (compared to $0$ in the standard\ndefinition). We find that already for a small cheating penalty, the landscape\nof coin-flipping changes dramatically. For example, with $\\Lambda=0.01$, we\nexhibit a protocol where neither Alice nor Bob can bias the result in their\nfavour beyond $1/2 + 10^{-8}$, which uses $24$ qubits and $10^{16}$ rounds of\ncommunication (provably $10^{7}$ times better than any weak coin-flipping\nprotocol with matching security). For the same space requirements, we\ndemonstrate how one can choose between lowering how much a malicious party can\nbias the result (down to $1/2 + 10^{-10}$) and reducing the rounds of\ncommunication (down to $25,180$), depending on what is preferred. To find these\nprotocols, we make two technical contributions. First, we extend the point\ngame-protocol correspondence introduced by Kitaev and Mochon, to incorporate:\n(i) approximate point games, (ii) the cheat-penalised setting, and (iii) round\nand space complexity.

For this purpose, we consider a model of mixed state quantum\ncomputation where one is promised concordant states at all stages of the\nquantum circuit. A concordant quantum state has zero discord with respect to\nany part and there exists a basis made up of a tensor product of orthonormal\nlocal subsystem basis in which the density matrix is diagonal. Efficient\nclassical simulation of concordant computation has surprisingly been an\noutstanding question in quantum information theory. We argue that a key\ningredient of an efficient classical simulation algorithm, a knowledge of the\nlocal basis in which the multi-party state is diagonal, is made available by\nquantum Darwinism. Concordant states in the absence of quantum Darwinism cannot\nbe efficiently simulated by existing methods and give a cryptographic advantage\nin communication.
