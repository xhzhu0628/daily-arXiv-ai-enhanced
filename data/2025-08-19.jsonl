For\nthe particular case of estimating Pauli observables, entangling two-copy\nmeasurement schemes can offer an exponential improvement in sample complexity\nover any single-copy strategy conceivable [1, Huang, Kueng, Preskill,\nPRL(2021)]. A recent refinement of these ideas by King et al. [2, King, Gosset,\nKothari, Babbush, SODA (2025)] does not only achieve polynomial sample\ncomplexity, but also maintains reasonable computational demands and utilizes\njoint measurements on only a small constant number of state copies. This\n`triple efficiency' is achievable for any subset of $n$-qubit Pauli\nobservables, whereas single-copy strategies can only be efficient if the Pauli\nobservables have advantageous structure. In this work, we complement existing\ntheoretical performance guarantees with the empirical evaluation of triply\nefficient shadow tomography using classical, noise-free simulations. Our\nfindings indicate that the empirical sample complexity aligns closely with\ntheoretical predictions for stabilizer states and, notably, demonstrates\nslightly improved scaling for random Gibbs states compared to established\ntheoretical bounds. In addition, we improve a central subroutine in the\ntriply-efficient shadow protocol by leveraging insights from a refined quantum\nand quantum-inspired convex optimization algorithm [3, Henze et al.\narXiv:2502.15426 (2025)]. To summarize, our empirical sample complexity studies\nof triply efficient shadow tomography not only confirm existing theoretical\nscaling behavior, but also showcase that the actual constants involved are\ncomparatively benign.

We introduce Block Encoding of Linear\nTransformation (BELT), a systematic protocol that simulates arbitrary linear\nmaps by embedding the output $\\mathcal{N}(\\rho)$ into a block of a unitary\noperator. BELT enables the manipulation and extraction of information about\n$\\mathcal{N}(\\rho)$ through coherent quantum evolution. Notably, BELT\naccommodates maps that fall outside the scope of quantum singular value\ntransformation, such as the transpose map. BELT finds applications in\nentanglement detection, quantum channel inversion, and simulating\npseudo-differential operators, and demonstrates improved sample complexity\ncompared to protocols based on Hermitian-preserving map exponentiation."}
