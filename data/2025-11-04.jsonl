Comments welcome!", "summary": "Adiabatic reverse annealing (ARA) has been proposed as an improvement to\nconventional quantum annealing for solving optimization problems, in which one\ntakes advantage of an initial guess at the solution to suppress problematic\nphase transitions. Here we interpret the performance of ARA through its effects\non the free energy landscape, and use the intuition gained to introduce a\nclassical analogue to ARA termed ``simulated reverse annealing'' (SRA). This\nmakes it more difficult to claim that ARA provides a quantum advantage in\nsolving a given problem, as not only must ARA succeed but the corresponding SRA\nmust fail. As a solvable example, we analyze how both protocols behave in the\ninfinite-range (non-disordered) $p$-spin model. Through both the thermodynamic\nphase diagrams and explicit dynamical behavior, we establish that the quantum\nalgorithm has no advantage over its classical counterpart: SRA succeeds not\nonly in every case where ARA does but even in a narrow range of parameters\nwhere ARA fails."}

Conventional\nresonant excitation, an excellent approach to maximize the coherence and\nindistinguishability of the SPS, often requires polarization filtering to\nremove the pump signal and isolate the qubit emission, but this results in an\ninherent 50\\% hit to the efficiency. Recent excitation schemes strategically\ntry to exploit pulses that excite the qubit while avoiding spectral overlap to\nbypass this required filtering. In this work, we compare three such pumping\nschemes to quantify the important SPS figures-of-merit for off-resonant quantum\ndot schemes, using: (i) a symmetrically detuned dichromatic pulse, (ii) a\nnotch-filtered adiabatic rapid passage (NARP) pulse, and (iii) a swing up of\nthe quantum emitter population (SUPER) pulse. Due to large instantaneous pulse\nstrengths, the dichromatic pulse suffers from phonon-induced dephasing which\ncan lower the SPS performance by up to 50\\%. In contrast, the NARP and SUPER\npulses are shielded from phonon coupling to differing degrees but both maintain\nexcellent SPS performance.

One way to tap into this potential is by reformulating combinatorial\nproblems as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. The\nsolution of the QUBO reformulation can then be addressed using adiabatic\nquantum computing devices or appropriate quantum computing algorithms on\ngate-based quantum computing devices. In general, QUBO reformulations of\ncombinatorial problems can be readily obtained by properly penalizing the\nviolation of the problem's constraints in the original problem's objective.\nHowever, characterizing tight (i.e., minimal but sufficient) penalty\ncoefficients for this purpose is critical for enabling the solution of the\nresulting QUBO in current and near-term quantum computing devices.

Our approach utilizes a fixed-frequency transmon coupler and\nmulti-path coupling, thereby sufficiently reducing the net transverse\ninteraction between data transmons to suppress residual ZZ interactions.

Weak values are\nconsidered to be abstract properties of systems describing a complete picture\nbetween successive measurements in the two-state vector formalism (TSVF). The\nremarkable achievements of the weak value formalism in experimental quantum\nmechanics have persuaded most quantum physicists that it is impeccable.\nHowever, we explore a scenario where the formalism of weak values for mixed\nstates is employed in a quantum communication protocol, but discover that it\ngenerates inaccurate outcomes. This reinforces our previous conclusion that the\nweak values may not be elements of the reality of weak measurements, contrary\nto what the proponents of weak values proposed."}

Direct fidelity\nestimation (DFE) enables this without full tomography by sampling observables\naccording to a target-dependent distribution. However, existing approaches face\nnotable trade-offs. Grouping-based DFE achieves strong accuracy for small\nsystems but suffers from exponential scaling, and its applicability is\nrestricted to Pauli measurements. In contrast, classical-shadow-based DFE\noffers scalability but yields lower accuracy on structured states. In this\nwork, we address these limitations by developing two classes of operator-aware\nshadow importance sampling algorithms using informationally overcomplete\npositive operator-valued measures. Instantiated with local Pauli measurements,\nour algorithm improves upon the grouping-based algorithms for Haar-random\nstates. For structured states such as the GHZ and W states, our algorithm also\neliminates the exponential memory requirements of previous grouping-based\nmethods. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve\nstate-of-the-art performance across Haar-random, GHZ, and W targets."}

Three distinct\nmeasurement schemes are analyzed: local Z-basis measurements (LZM), joint\nBell-state measurements (JBM), and pre-shared entanglement-assisted\nmeasurements (PEM). For each scheme, we derive the probability distributions of\nmeasurement outcomes and examine how noise in the distributed states influences\nestimation precision. Closed-form expressions for the Quantum Fisher\nInformation Matrix (QFIM) are obtained, and the estimation precision is\nevaluated through the Quantum Cramer-Rao Bound (QCRB). Numerical analysis\nreveals that the PEM scheme achieves the lowest QCRB, offering the highest\nestimation accuracy, while JBM provides a favorable balance between precision\nand implementation complexity. The LZM method, although experimentally simpler,\nexhibits higher estimation error relative to the other schemes; however, it\noutperforms JBM in high-noise regimes for single-link estimation. We further\nevaluate the estimation performance on a four-node star network by comparing a\nJBM-only configuration with a hybrid configuration that combines JBM and LZM.\nWhen two monitors are used, the JBM-only strategy outperforms the hybrid\napproach across all noise regimes. However, with three monitors, it achieves a\nlower QCRB only in low-noise regimes with heterogeneous links. The results\nestablish a practical basis for selecting measurement strategies in\nexperimental quantum networks, enabling more accurate and scalable link\nparameter estimation under realistic noise conditions."}

Comments and questions are very welcome", "summary": "Relaxation in open quantum systems is fundamental to quantum science and\ntechnologies. Yet, the influence of the initial state on relaxation remains a\ncentral, largely unanswered question. Here, by systematically characterizing\nthe relaxation behavior of generic initial states, we uncover a typicality\nphenomenon in high-dimensional open quantum systems: relaxation becomes nearly\ninitial-state-independent as system size increases under verifiable conditions.\nCrucially, we prove this typicality for thermalization processes above a\nsize-independent temperature. Our findings extend the typicality to open\nquantum dynamics, in turn identifying a class of systems where two widely used\nquantities -- the Liouvillian gap and the maximal relaxation time -- merit\nre-examination. We formalize this with two new concepts: the 'typical strong\nMpemba effect' and the 'typical relaxation time'. Beyond these conceptual\nadvances, our results provide practical implications: a scalable route to\naccelerating relaxation and a typical mixing-time benchmark that complements\nconventional worst-case metrics for quantum simulations and state preparation."}

Here, we identify\nQCBMs as a quantum Fourier model independently of the loss function. This\nallows us to apply known dequantization conditions when the optimal quantum\ndistribution is available. However, realizing this distribution is hindered by\ntrainability issues such as vanishing gradients on quantum hardware. Recent\ntrain-classical, deploy-quantum approaches propose training classical\nsurrogates of QCBMs and using quantum devices only for inference. We analyze\nthe limitations of these methods arising from deployment discrepancies between\nclassically trained and quantumly deployed parameters. Using the Fourier\ndecomposition of the Born rule in terms of correlators, we quantify this\ndiscrepancy analytically. Approximating the decomposition via distribution\ntruncation and classical surrogation provides concrete examples of such\ndiscrepancies, which we demonstrate numerically. We study this effect using\ntensor-networks and Pauli-propagation-based classical surrogates.

In doing so, we derive closed-form\nexpressions for Pauli propagation in IQP circuits and the dynamical Lie algebra\nof the Haldane chain, which may be of independent interest."}
