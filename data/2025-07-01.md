### [1] [Spectral Bias in Variational Quantum Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22555)
*Callum Duffy,Marcin Jastrzebski*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了量子机器学习中的频谱偏差现象，发现参数化量子电路（PQCs）中的频谱偏差源于傅里叶系数的冗余性，且冗余性与梯度大小相关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨经典机器学习中频谱偏差现象在量子机器学习中的表现，特别是在PQCs中的影响。

Method: 利用PQCs的傅里叶级数形式，分析傅里叶系数的冗余性及其与梯度的关系，并通过三种编码方案进行实证研究。

Result: 发现冗余性高的PQCs对参数扰动更具鲁棒性，且大初始化和低纠缠方案会减缓收敛速度。

Conclusion: PQCs的设计选择（如编码方案、初始化和纠缠结构）显著影响其学习能力和收敛速度。

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the phenomenon of spectral bias in quantum
machine learning, where, in classical settings, models tend to fit
low-frequency components of a target function earlier during training than
high-frequency ones, demonstrating a frequency-dependent rate of convergence.
We study this effect specifically in parameterised quantum circuits (PQCs).
Leveraging the established formulation of PQCs as Fourier series, we prove that
spectral bias in this setting arises from the ``redundancy'' of the Fourier
coefficients, which denotes the number of terms in the analytical form of the
model contributing to the same frequency component. The choice of data encoding
scheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find
that the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training
strongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further
demonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.
Additionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit
increased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the
corresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability
of PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and
entanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement
schemes tend to slow convergence.

### [2] [Metric formalism for precision assessment in non-Hermitian systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22571)
*Javid Naikoo,Ravindra W. Chhajlany,Jan Kołodyński,Adam Miranowicz*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非厄米量子系统中量子Fisher信息（QFI）的不同解释方法，指出归一化形式会高估QFI的增强效果，而基于度量的解释更稳定可靠。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高量子系统的测量精度对量子传感和通信技术至关重要，但传统QFI方法在非厄米系统中的适用性需要重新评估。

Method: 研究了非厄米量子动力学的归一化和度量两种解释方法，并通过量子比特系统验证QFI的动态行为。

Result: 归一化形式会高估QFI的增强效果，而度量解释更接近厄米系统的结构，提供更稳定的精度评估。

Conclusion: 度量解释更适合量子计量学，能更准确地评估测量灵敏度，避免后选择带来的偏差。

Abstract: Enhancing measurement precision in quantum systems is vital for advancing
technologies like quantum sensing and communication. Traditionally, quantum
Fisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits
within Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to
non-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various
interpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and
metric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic
behaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In
particular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or
revivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the
evolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity
and accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains
consistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and
conservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more
natural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate
assessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for
post-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit
system, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for
quantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary
ways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics.

Result: 成功在八量子比特编码中实现了三逻辑比特的Grover算法，并清晰识别了目标解态。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了无测量量子计算的可行性，为未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: The ability to perform quantum error correction (QEC) and robust gate
operations on encoded qubits opens the door to demonstrations of quantum
algorithms. Contemporary QEC schemes typically require mid-circuit measurements
with feed-forward control, which are challenging for qubit control, often slow,
and susceptible to relatively high error rates. In this work, we propose and
experimentally demonstrate a universal toolbox of fault-tolerant logical
operations without mid-circuit measurements on a trapped-ion quantum processor.
We present modular logical state teleportation between two four-qubit
error-detecting codes without measurements during algorithm execution.
Moreover, we realize a fault-tolerant universal gate set on an eight-qubit
error-detecting code hosting three logical qubits, based on state injection,
which can be executed by coherent gate operations only. We apply this toolbox
to experimentally realize Grover's quantum search algorithm fault-tolerantly on
three logical qubits encoded in eight physical qubits, with the implementation
displaying clear identification of the desired solution states. Our work
demonstrates the practical feasibility and provides first steps into the
largely unexplored direction of measurement-free quantum computation.

Abstract: Superconducting resonators with high quality factors are extremely sensitive
detectors of the complex impedance of materials and devices coupled to them.
This capability has been used to measure losses in multiple different materials
and, in the case of circuit quantum electrodynamics (circuit QED), has been
used to measure the coherent evolution of multiple different types of qubits.
Here, we report on the implementation of a scanning resonator for probing
quantum coherent devices. Our scanning setup enables tunable coherent coupling
to systems of interest without the need for fabricating on-chip superconducting
resonators. We measure the internal quality factor of our resonator sensor in
the single-photon regime to be > 10000 and demonstrate capacitive imaging using
our sensor with zeptoFarad sensitivity and micron spatial resolution at
milliKelvin temperatures. We then use our setup to characterize the energy
spectrum and coherence times of multiple transmon qubits with no on-chip
readout circuitry. Our work introduces a new tool for using circuit QED to
measure existing and proposed qubit platforms.

### [5] [Lamb-Dicke Dynamics of Interacting Rydberg Atoms Coupled to the Motion of an Optical Tweezer Array](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22669)

Conclusion: 囚禁频率和Lamb-Dicke参数对里德堡原子的集体动力学有显著影响，可用于量子模拟和计算。

Abstract: Neutral Rydberg atoms trapped in optical tweezer arrays provide a platform
for quantum simulation and computation. In this work, we investigate the
Lamb-Dicke dynamics of coupled Rydberg atoms for different trapping
frequencies. We model the atomic motion by both internal and motional degrees
of freedom, in which the motional states arise due to the oscillation of each
atom in optical tweezer traps due to the light-atom interaction. In this setup,
the internal states are coupled to a laser light with a Rabi frequency, while
each internal state of each atom is also harmonically trapped with a trap
frequency that depends on the internal state. The impact of the coherent motion
of the optical tweezers on the collective dynamics of the many-body Rydberg
atoms is explored for varying Lamb-Dicke parameters and with different trap
frequencies. We see the occurrence of dynamical phases e.g., Rabi oscillations
in the decoupled limit, the limit torus phase for magic trapping, and the limit
cycle phase as the trap frequency is further increased.

### [6] [Entropic characterization of Tunneling and State Pairing in a Quasi-Exactly Solvable Sextic Potential](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22684)
*Angelina N. Mendoza Tavera,Adrian M. Escobar Ruiz,Robin P. Sagar*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了准精确可解六次势的局域化性质，通过变分波函数和熵度量揭示了隧穿和对称性破缺。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索准精确可解势的局域化特性和隧穿现象，验证熵度量在揭示量子态配对和对称性破缺中的优越性。

Method: 构造满足对称性和渐近行为的变分波函数，计算变分能量并与精确解比较，使用熵度量分析量子态特性。

Result: 变分波函数与精确解误差极小（10^-8至10^-6），熵度量成功揭示了隧穿和对称性破缺。

Conclusion: 熵度量优于传统方法，验证了不确定性关系，变分波函数质量高。

Abstract: We analyze the (de)localization properties of a quasi-exactly solvable (QES)
sextic potential $V_{\text{QES}}(x) = \frac{1}{2}(x^6 + 2x^4 - 2(2\lambda +
1)x^2)$ as a function of the tunable parameter $\lambda \in [-\frac{3}{4}, 6]$.
For $\lambda > -\frac{1}{2}$, the potential exhibits a symmetric double-well
structure, with tunneling emerging for the ground state level at $\lambda
\approx 0.732953$. {For the lowest energy states \( n = 0,1,2,3 \), we
construct physically meaningful variational wavefunctions that $i)$ respect
parity symmetry under the transformation $ x \rightarrow -x $, $ii)$ exhibit
the correct asymptotic behavior at large distances, and $iii)$ allow for exact
analytical Fourier transforms. Variational energies match Lagrange Mesh and
available exact analytical QES results with relative errors $\simeq 10^{-8}$
for $n = 0, 1, 2$ and $\simeq 10^{-6}$ for the third excited state $n=3$. We
demonstrate that entropic measures (Shannon entropy, Kullback-Leibler, and
Cumulative Residual Jeffreys divergences) surpass conventional variance-based
methods in revealing tunneling transitions, wavefunction symmetry breaking, and
quantum state pairing. Our results confirm that the
Beckner-Bialynicki-Birula-Mycielski entropic uncertainty relation holds across
all examined values of $n$ and $\lambda$. The quality of the trial function is
also validated by the small $\sim10^{-10}$ Cumulative Residual Jeffreys
divergences from the exact QES solutions.

Result: 发现无间隙谱、帕累托原则等独特性质，量子相干性增强两个数量级。

Conclusion: 重尾开放量子系统为量子传感应用提供了理想平台。

Abstract: Understanding random open quantum systems is critical for characterizing the
performance of large-scale quantum devices and exploring macroscopic quantum
phenomena. Various features in these systems, including spectral distributions,
gap scaling, and decoherence, have been examined by modelling randomness under
the central limit theorem. Here, we investigate random open quantum systems
beyond the central limit theorem, focusing on heavy-tailed system-environment
interactions. By extending the Ginibre unitary ensemble, we model
system-environment interactions to exhibit a continuous transition from
light-tailed to heavy-tailed distributions. This generalized configuration
reveals unique properties-gapless spectra, Pareto principle governing
dissipation, orthogonalization, and quasi-degeneracies-all linked to the
violation of the central limit theorem. The synergy of these features
challenges the common belief-the tradeoff between stability and
sensitivity-through the emergence of long-lived and ultrasensitive quantum
coherences that exhibit an enhancement of two orders of magnitude compared to
predictions under the central limit theorem. The result, which is based on
heavy-tailedness of open quantum systems, provides highly desirable platforms
for quantum sensing applications.

### [8] [Extended Non-Markovian Stochastic Schrödinger Equation with Complex Frequency Modes for General Basis Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22738)
*Yukai Guo,Zeyu Huang,Xing Gao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 扩展的非马尔可夫随机薛定谔方程（extended cNMSSE）通过复杂频率模式处理开放量子系统动力学，适用于一般谱密度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统cNMSSE框架仅适用于Debye型谱结构，扩展版本旨在处理更一般的环境谱密度。

Method: 使用非指数基展开浴相关函数，结合伪Fock空间和矩阵乘积态（MPS）技术进行数值求解。

Result: 在四种代表性谱密度下的模拟结果与HFB-SSE和HEOM方法一致，验证了方法的准确性。

Conclusion: 扩展cNMSSE为一般环境下的非马尔可夫开放量子系统提供了高效且可扩展的模拟框架。

Abstract: We present an extended formulation of the non-Markovian stochastic
Schr\"odinger equation with complex frequency modes (extended cNMSSE), enabling
the treatment of open quantum system dynamics under general spectral densities.
This extension employs complete non-exponential basis expansions for the bath
correlation functions, thereby generalizing the applicability of the cNMSSE
framework beyond environments with Debye-type spectral structures. By
preserving the wavefunction-based description and favorable linear-scaling
properties, the extended cNMSSE offers an efficient and flexible approach to
simulate non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The method is implemented within a
pseudo-Fock space using conventional ladder operators and solved numerically
via matrix product state (MPS) techniques. Benchmark simulations on four
representative cases, including discrete spectra, Ohmic spectra with
exponential and algebraic cutoffs, and critically damped Brownian spectral
densities, demonstrate excellent agreement with results of hierarchy of
forward-backward stochastic Schr\"odinger equations (HFB-SSE) and extended
hierarchical equation of motion (HEOM). The extended cNMSSE thus provides a
robust and scalable framework for accurate simulations of non-Markovian open
quantum systems with general environments.

Result: 发现连续监测下寿命呈指数增长，无监测时线性增长或恒定，且与浴大小相关。

Conclusion: 研究结果为监测量子电路、量子算法和量子通信提供了新见解，并通过实验模拟验证了可行性。

Abstract: Quantum information is typically fragile under measurement and environmental
coupling. Remarkably, we find that its lifetime can scale exponentially with
system size when the environment is continuously monitored via mid-circuit
measurements -- regardless of bath size. Starting from a maximally entangled
state with a reference, we analytically prove this exponential scaling for
typical Haar random unitaries and confirm it through numerical simulations in
both Haar-random and chaotic Hamiltonian systems. In the absence of bath
monitoring, the lifetime exhibits a markedly different scaling: it grows at
most linearly -- or remains constant -- with system size and decays inversely
with bath size. We further extend our findings numerically to a broad class of
initial states. We discuss implications for monitored quantum circuits in the
weak measurement limit, quantum algorithms such as quantum diffusion models and
quantum reservoir computing, and quantum communication. Finally, we evaluate
the feasibility of resolving the predicted scaling regimes experimentally via
noisy simulations of IBM Quantum hardwares.

Result: 在模拟环境中验证了方法的可行性，并展示了GASP在量子电路设计中的潜力。

Conclusion: QSA算法的实际部署可行，GASP在量子生物信息学等数据密集型问题中具有潜力。

Abstract: This paper presents the implementation of a quantum sequence alignment (QSA)
algorithm on biological data in both simulated environments and real noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers. The approach to quantum
bioinformatics adapts the original QSA algorithm proposed in 2000 to current
capabilities and limitations of NISQ-era quantum computers and uses a genetic
algorithm for state preparation (GASP) to create encoding circuits to load both
database and target sequences into the quantum data registers. The
implementation is tested in a simulated quantum computer environment to
validate the approach and refine the GASP data-loading circuit designs. The
results demonstrate the practicalities of deploying the QSA algorithm and
exemplify the potential of GASP for data encoding in the realm of quantum
circuit design, particularly for complex algorithms in quantum bioinformatics
and other data-rich problems.

Result: 该方法在某些问题上比量子神经网络更准确。

Conclusion: 该方法为QITE在量子机器学习中的应用奠定了基础，并可能扩展到其他量子机器学习算法。

Abstract: Quantum imaginary time evolution (QITE) is a powerful method to derive the
ground states of the systems. Only the damping of quantum states leads it;
hence, reaching the ground state is guaranteed by nature without any external
manipulation. Numerous QITE methods by many groups are used to improve speed
and accuracy, derive excited states, and solve combined optimization problems.
However, the QITE methods have not been used for quantum machine learning to
predict the ideal values for multiple input values. Therefore, we propose a
method for applying QITE methods for quantum machine learning and demonstrate
fitting problems of elementary functions and classification problems on a 2-D
plane. As a result, we confirmed that our method was more accurate than a
quantum neural network in solving some problems. Our method can be used for
other quantum machine learning algorithms; hence, it may be the milestone for
applying QITE to quantum machine learning.

Abstract: Coherent, continuous-wave, and electrically tunable chip-scale terahertz
(THz) sources are critical for emerging applications in sensing, imaging,
spectroscopy, communication, space and quantum technologies. Here, we
demonstrate a robust source-on-a-chip THz emitter based on a layered
high-temperature superconductor, engineered with an elliptical microcavity and
capable of sustained coherent emission over an unprecedented operational
lifetime exceeding 11 years. This compact THz source operates up to 60 K, with
Tc= 90 K, delivering stable radiation in the 0.7-0.8 THz range, with on-chip
electrical tunability from 100 GHz to 1 THz. Coherence arises from the
phase-locked oscillation of intrinsic Josephson junction arrays, resonantly
coupled to transverse electromagnetic modes within the cavity, analogous to a
laser cavity, yielding collective macroscopic oscillations. THz emission
remains detectable across a 0.5 m free-space open-air link at room temperature.
We analyse the cavity-mode structure and extract THz photon generation rates up
to 503 photons fs-1 in cryogenic conditions and 50-260 photons ps-1
over-the-air. These results establish long-term coherent THz emission from
superconductors and chart a viable path toward scalable, tunable, solid-state
coherent THz laser-on-a-chip platforms, especially for future classical and
quantum systems.

Conclusion: 研究为实际光子网络中纯化深度和操作点的优化提供了实用指导，首次详细绘制了DEJMPS协议在连续噪声下的性能图谱。

Abstract: Entanglement purification is a critical enabling technology for quantum
communication, allowing high-fidelity entangled pairs to be distilled from
noisy resources. We present a comprehensive Monte Carlo study of the DEJMPS
purification protocol applied to polarization-entangled photon pairs subject to
both amplitude-damping noise (gamma) and dephasing noise (p). By sweeping
(gamma, p) over a two-dimensional grid and performing repeated stochastic
trials, we map out the average fidelity and average yield surfaces of the
purified output, as well as the net gains (DF) and losses (DY) relative to the
unpurified baseline. Our results show that a single round of DEJMPS
purification can boost entanglement fidelity by up to 0.07 in high-noise
regimes, while incurring a yield penalty of up to 0.55. Fidelity gains grow
monotonically with both gamma and p, whereas yields decline more sharply under
combined noise. Contour and 3D surface plots of DF(gamma, p) and (DY, gamma, p)
vividly illustrate the trade-off between quality and quantity of distilled
pairs. This two-parameter Monte Carlo characterization provides practical
guidance for optimizing purification depth and operating points in real-world
photonic networks, and represents, to our knowledge, the first detailed
numerical charting of both fidelity and yield improvements across a continuous
noise landscape for DEJMPS.

Abstract: Despite their Nobel Prize-winning empirical falsification, the interpretation
of the Bell inequality remains a subject of controversy. This article discusses
and attempts to clarify the reasons John S. Bell and A. Einstein claimed that
quantum entanglement implies puzzling nonlocal correlations that Einstein
famously termed ``spooky action at a distance.'' The issue remains highly
controversial and has roughly divided the scientific community into localists
and nonlocalists. Without taking a stance for either side in the long-standing,
polarized debate, we examine Bell's actual argument, highlighting the
differences between his approach and the current orthodoxy.

Abstract: The MPC-in-the-head technique (Ishai et al., STOC 2007) is a celebrated
method to build zero-knowledge protocols with desirable theoretical properties
and high practical efficiency. This technique has generated a large body of
research and has influenced the design of real-world post-quantum cryptographic
signatures. In this work, we present a generalization of the MPC-in-the-head
paradigm to the quantum setting, where the MPC is running a quantum
computation. As an application of our framework, we propose a new approach to
build zero-knowledge protocols where security holds even against a verifier
that can obtain a superposition of transcripts. This notion was pioneered by
Damgard et al., who built a zero-knowledge protocol for NP (in the common
reference string model) secure against superposition attacks, by relying on
perfectly hiding and unconditionally binding dual-mode commitments.
Unfortunately, no such commitments are known from standard cryptographic
assumptions. In this work we revisit this problem, and present two new
three-round protocols in the common reference string model: (i) A
zero-knowledge argument for NP, whose security reduces to the standard learning
with errors (LWE) problem. (ii) A zero-knowledge argument for QMA from the same
assumption.

Conclusion: 该协议为紧凑、高容量的连续变量量子密钥分发系统提供了新思路，适用于地面和太空通信。

Abstract: We propose a novel continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CVQKD)
protocol that employs orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) in the
terahertz (THz) band to enable high-throughput and secure quantum
communication. By encoding quantum information across multiple subcarriers, the
protocol enhances spectral efficiency and mitigates channel dispersion and
atmospheric attenuation. We present a comprehensive security analysis under
collective Gaussian attacks, considering both terrestrial free-space channels,
accounting for humidity-induced absorption, and inter-satellite links,
incorporating realistic intermodulation noise. Simulations show secret key
rates (SKR) reaching ~72 bits per channel use in open-air conditions. While
intermodulation noise imposes trade-offs, optimised modulation variance enables
resilience and secure communication range. The maximum terrestrial quantum link
extends up to 4.5 m due to atmospheric THz absorption, whereas inter-satellite
links can support secure communication over distances exceeding 100 km, owing
to minimal propagation channel losses in space. We evaluate the practical
implementation of our protocol using recently developed on-chip coherent THz
sources based on superconducting Josephson junctions. These compact,
voltage-tunable emitters produce wideband coherent radiation, making them ideal
candidates for integration in scalable quantum networks. By incorporating their
characteristics into our simulations, we assess secure key generation under
various environmental conditions. Our results show secure communication over
distances up to 3 m in open air, and up to 26 km in cryogenic or vacuum
environments. This work advances the prospect of compact, high-capacity CVQKD
systems for both terrestrial and space-based THz quantum communication.

Abstract: We introduce groundbreaking techniques in image encryption, assuming the
existence of quantum computing ressources functioning with qudits, where d is a
power of 2. Our quantum representation of color multi-image is based on
space-filling curves and allows to reduce the storage space. We generalize the
quantum baker map, so that it may scramble two n-qudits. By doing so, we
enlarge its parameter space exponentially, leading to a better security. We
define two new concepts of mixed scrambling and mixed diffusion, and present a
variety of schemes, depending on the needs of the users.

results establish ONER as a scalable and experimentally viable platform for

Abstract: Graphs are a fundamental representation of complex, nonlinear structured data
across various domains, including social networks and quantum systems. Quantum
Graph Recurrent Neural Networks (QGRNNs) have been proposed to model quantum
dynamics in graph-based quantum systems, but their applicability to classical
data remains an open problem. In this paper, we leverage QGRNNs to process
classical graph-structured data. In particular, we demonstrate how QGRNN can
reconstruct node features in classical datasets. Our results show that QGRNN
achieves high feature reconstruction accuracy, leading to near-perfect
classification. Furthermore, we propose an information hiding technique based
on our QGRNN, where messages are embedded into a graph, then retrieved under
certain conditions. We assess retrieval accuracy for different dictionary sizes
and message lengths, showing that QGRNN maintains high retrieval accuracy, with
minor degradation as complexity increases. These findings demonstrate the
scalability and robustness of QGRNNs for both classical data processing and
secure information hiding, paving the way for quantum-enhanced feature
extraction, privacy-preserving computations, and quantum steganography.

Abstract: Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is a cutting-edge field that leverages the
principles of quantum mechanics to enable secure communication between parties
involved. Single-photon quantum emitters offer remarkable on-demand photon
emission, near-unitary indistinguishability, and low multiphoton generation,
thereby enhancing the performance of QKD protocols. Standard approaches in
which the polarization degree-of-freedom is exploited are limited by the
precise alignment between the communicating parties. To overcome this obstacle,
the Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) of light represents a suitable candidate for
encoding the information, as it allows the implementation of
rotational-invariant photonic states that remove the need for a fixed physical
reference frame between the communicating parties. Here, we report the
implementation of an on-demand, rotational-invariant BB84-QKD protocol achieved
by exploiting a bright quantum dot source, active time-to-spatial
demultiplexing, and Q-plate devices with a space-variant pattern to encode
hybrid photonic states. Our findings suggest a viable direction for the use of
rotational-invariant hybrid states in on-demand QKD protocols, potentially
enhancing security and robustness in complex operational scenarios.

performance as we scale and increase the algorithmic complexity the quantum
hardware is capable of running, the algorithmic radius, towards a point that
sets us up for quantum advantage with deep noisy intermediate-scale quantum

Abstract: We tackle the issue of estimating dynamical parameters in quantum
electrodynamics. We numerically compute the quantum Fisher information matrix
(QFIM) of physical parameters in electron-muon and Compton scattering at tree
level. In particular, we consider the estimation of centre-of-mass
three-momentum magnitude and polar scattering angle through measurements on the
internal degrees of freedom (helicity or polarisation) of the scattered
particles. Computations are carried out for pure and maximally mixed initial
states. The QFIM values are then used to compute the quantum Cram\'er-Rao lower
bounds on the estimations at hand. Further, we compare such ultimate bounds to
the classical Fisher information of local polarisation or helicity degrees of
freedom.

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising approach
for solving partial differential equations by embedding the governing physics
into the loss function associated with deep neural network. In this work, a
Quantum Physics-Informed Neural Network (QPINN) framework is proposed to solve
two-dimensional (2D) time-dependent Maxwell's equations. Our approach utilizes
a parameterized quantum circuit in conjunction with the classical neural
network architecture and enforces physical laws, including a global energy
conservation principle, during training. A quantum simulation library was
developed to efficiently compute circuit outputs and derivatives by leveraging
GPU acceleration based on PyTorch, enabling end-to-end training of the QPINN.
The method was evaluated on two 2D electromagnetic wave propagation problems:
one in free space (vacuum) and one with a dielectric medium. Multiple quantum
circuit ans\"atze, input scales, and an added loss term were compared in a
thorough ablation study. Furthermore, recent techniques to enhance PINN
convergence, including random Fourier feature embeddings and adaptive
time-weighting, were incorporated. Our results demonstrate that the QPINN
achieves accuracy comparable, and even greater than the classical PINN
baseline, while using a significantly smaller number of trainable parameters.
This study also shows that adding an energy conservation term to the loss
stabilizes training and improves the physical fidelity of the solution in the
lossless free-space case. This added term helps mitigate a new kind of a barren
plateau (BP) related phenomenon - ``black hole'' (BH) loss landscape for the
quantum experiments in that scenario. By optimizing the quantum-circuit ansatz
and embedding energy-conservation constraints, our QPINN achieves up to a 19
percent higher accuracy on 2D Maxwell benchmark problems compared to a
classical PINN.

Conclusion: 该方法为有限维系统中的纠缠检测提供了实用且概念优雅的增强方案。

Abstract: Entanglement witnesses (EWs) are fundamental tools for detecting
entanglement. However traditional linear witnesses often fail to identify most
of the entangled states. In this work, we construct a family of nonlinear
entanglement witnesses by taking the envelope of linear witnesses defined over
continuous families of pure bipartite states with fixed Schmidt bases. This
procedure effectively "bends" the hyperplanes associated with linear witnesses
into curved hypersurfaces, thereby extending the region of detectable entangled
states. The resulting conditions can be expressed in terms of the positive
semi-definiteness of a family of matrices, whose principal minors define a
hierarchy of increasingly sensitive detection criteria. We show that this
construction is not limited to the transposition map and generalizes naturally
to arbitrary Positive but not Completely Positive (PnCP) maps, leading to
nonlinear analogues of general entanglement witnesses. We emphasize that the
required measurements remain experimentally accessible, as the nonlinear
criteria are still formulated in terms of expectation values over local
operator bases. Through both analytical and numerical examples, we demonstrate
that the proposed nonlinear witnesses outperform their linear counterparts in
detecting entangled states which may evade individual linear EWs in the
construction. This approach offers a practical and conceptually elegant
enhancement to entanglement detection in finite-dimensional systems.

Abstract: We study the efficacy of the two recently introduced witnesses of
non-Markovianity, namely that based on temporal correlations in pseudo-density
matrix and temporal steering correlations in detecting information backflow. We
show, through specific counterexamples taken from existing literature, that
they can witness a process to be non-Markovian where trace distance and
entropic distinguishability measures may fail. We further show that, since the
pseudo-density matrix is directly related to the Choi matrix of a channel via
the partial transpose, it can be generalized to quantify the total quantum
memory in any indivisible process. Moreover, we make an interesting observation
that temporal steerable correlations-based measure may not capture eternal
non-Markovianity hence may not be proportional to Choi-matrix-based methods,
while pseudo-density matrix-based measures introduced in this work faithfully
capture eternal non-Markovianity. Our work highlights important distinction
between weak and strong forms of quantum direct cause in quantum mechanics when
applied to open system dynamics.

Abstract: Operator scrambling, which governs the spread of quantum information in
many-body systems, is a central concept in both condensed matter and
high-energy physics. Accurately capturing the emergent properties of these
systems remains a formidable challenge for classical computation, while quantum
simulators have emerged as a powerful tool to address this complexity. In this
work, we reveal a fundamental connection between operator scrambling and the
reliability of quantum simulations. We show that the Trotter error in
simulating operator dynamics is bounded by the degree of operator scrambling,
providing the most refined analysis of Trotter errors in operator dynamics so
far. Furthermore, we investigate the entanglement properties of the evolved
states, revealing that sufficient entanglement can lead to error scaling
governed by the normalized Frobenius norms of both the observables of interest
and the error operator, thereby enhancing simulation robustness and efficiency
compared to previous works. We also show that even in regimes where the
system's entanglement remains low, operator-induced entanglement can still
emerge and suppress simulation errors. Our results unveil a comprehensive
relationship between Trotterization, operator scrambling, and entanglement,
offering new perspectives for optimizing quantum simulations.

Abstract: In this paper, we describe some interesting properties of a spin-oscillator
system with non-Hermitian coupling. As shown earlier, the Hilbert space of this
problem can be described by infinitely-many closed two-dimensional invariant
subspaces together with the global ground state. We expose the appearance of
exceptional points (EP) on such two-dimensional subspaces together with quantum
phase transitions marking the transit from real to complex eigenvalues. We
analytically compute some information-theoretic measures for this intriguing
system, namely, the thermal entropy as well as the von Neumann and R\'enyi
entropies using the framework of the so-called \(G\)-inner product. Such
entropic measures are verified to be non-analytic at the points which mark the
quantum phase transitions on the space of parameters -- a naive comparison with
Ehrenfest's classification of phase transitions then suggests that these
transitions are of the first order as the first derivatives of the entropies
are discontinuous across such transitions.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the phase space formulation of the Jaynes-Cummings
model through the explicit construction of the full Wigner function for a
hybrid bipartite quantum system composed of a two-level atom and a quantized
coherent field. By employing the Stratonovich-Weyl correspondence and the
coadjoint orbit method, we derive an informationally complete quasi-probability
distribution that captures the full dynamics of light-matter interaction. This
approach provides a detailed phase space perspective of fundamental quantum
phenomena such as Rabi oscillations, atomic population inversion, and
entanglement generation. We further measure the purity of the reduced quantized
field state by means of an appropriate Wigner function corresponding to the
bosonic field part in order to investigate the entanglement dynamics of the
system.

Abstract: A quantum-mechanical wave function is complex, but all observations are real,
expressible through expectation values and transition matrix elements that
involve the wave functions. It can be useful to separate at the outset the
amplitude and phase as real quantities that together carry the same information
that is contained in the complex wave function. Two main avenues for doing so
go way back in the history of the subject and have been used both for
scattering and bound states. A connection is made here to gauge transformations
of electrodynamics where the advent of quantum mechanics and later quantum
field theory showed the central role that local gauge transformations play in
physics.

Abstract: High-sensitivity magnetometers play a crucial role in various domains,
including fundamental physics, biomedical imaging, and navigation. Levitated
diamonds containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers exhibit significant potential
for magnetic sensing due to their high mechanical quality (Q) factor and long
spin coherence time. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on
electron spin-based measurements of alternating current (AC) magnetic fields.
In this letter, we propose a novel approach for direct current (DC) magnetic
field measurement based on the Berry phase generated by three-dimensional
rotation. We analyze the adiabatic evolution of the 14N nuclear spin inside a
levitated 3D rotating diamond with frequencies around MHz. Our finding reveals
that the Berry phase exhibits high sensitivity to external parameters near
rotation induced nuclear spin resonance. Using this mechanism, we theoretically
demonstrate that the static magnetic field sensitivity can reach 10^(-7)
T/Hz^(1/2)/N^(1/2) for 14N nuclear spins under the current experimental
conditions.

Abstract: We study parametric oscillations of two capacitively coupled Kerr parametric
oscillators (KPOs) with frequency-chirped two- and one-photon drives. The
two-KPO system adiabatically evolves from the initial vacuum state to an
oscillation state corresponding to a solution state in quantum-annealing
applications. Frequency chirping dynamically changes the detuning between
resonance and oscillation frequencies during parametric modulation and reduces
unwanted population transfer to excited states caused by pure dephasing and
photon loss. We observe that frequency chirping increases the success
probability to obtain the solution state and that simulations taking into
account pure dephasing reproduce experiments with and without frequency
chirping. This study demonstrates the effectiveness and applicability of
frequency chirping to a KPO-based quantum annealer.

Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental technique for estimating the
state of a quantum system from measured data and plays a crucial role in
evaluating the performance of quantum devices. However, standard estimation
methods become impractical due to the exponential growth of parameters in the
state representation. In this work, we address this challenge by parameterizing
the state using a low-rank block tensor train decomposition and demonstrate
that our approach is both memory- and computationally efficient. This framework
applies to a broad class of quantum states that can be well approximated by
low-rank decompositions, including pure states, nearly pure states, and ground
states of Hamiltonians.

Abstract: Trapped ions constitute a promising platform for implementation of a quantum
network. Recently, a dual-type qubit scheme has been realized in a quantum
network node where the communication qubits and the memory qubits are encoded
in different energy levels of the same ion species, such that the generation of
ion-photon entanglement on the communication qubits has negligible crosstalk
error on the preloaded quantum information in the memory qubits. However, to
achieve the versatile applications of a quantum network, a crucial component of
the dual-type node, namely the entangling gate between the communication and
the memory qubits, is still missing. Here we report a dual-type quantum network
node equipped with ion-photon entanglement generation, crosstalk-free quantum
memory and entangling gates between the dual-type qubits simultaneously. We
demonstrate its practical applications including the quantum state
teleportation and the preparation of multipartite entangled state. Our work
achieves the necessary components of a dual-type quantum network node and paves
the way toward its applications in a large-scale quantum internet.

Abstract: The traditional clustering problem of renewable energy profiles is typically
formulated as a combinatorial optimization that suffers from the Curse of
Dimensionality (CoD) on classical computers. To address this issue, this paper
first proposed a kernel-based quantum clustering method. More specifically, the
kernel-based similarity between profiles with minimal intra-group distance is
encoded into the ground-state of the Hamiltonian in the form of an Ising model.
Then, this NP-hard problem can be reformulated into a Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization (QUBO), which a Coherent Ising Machine (CIM) can naturally
solve with significant improvement over classical computers. The test results
from a real optical quantum computer verify the validity of the proposed
method. It also demonstrates its ability to address CoD in an NP-hard
clustering problem.

Abstract: We demonstrate how observables with optimal sensitivity to environmental
properties can be constructed explicitly from the master equation of an
open-quantum system. Our approach does not rely on the explicit solution of the

Abstract: Quantum networks with independent sources allow observing quantum nonlocality
or steering with just a single measurement per node of the network, or without
any inputs. Inspired by the recently introduced notion of swap-steering, we
consider here the triangle network scenario without inputs, where one of the
parties is trusted to perform a well-calibrated measurement. In this scenario,
we first propose a linear witness to detect triangle network swap-steering.
Then, by using the correlations that achieve the maximum value of this
inequality, and assuming that all the sources are the same, we can self-test
the state generated by the sources and the measurements of the untrusted party.
We then extend this framework to ring networks with an arbitrary number of
nodes with one of them being trusted. Interestingly, this is the first example
of a topologically robust, that is, one can observe steerability without
assuming the network structure of the network, as well as noise-robust quantum
advantage in a network. Additionally, by allowing the trusted party to perform
tomography of their subsystems, we demonstrate that every bipartite entangled
state will result in swap-steerable correlations in the ring network. For this
purpose, we construct linear witnesses to detect ring network swap-steering
corresponding to every bipartite entangled state.

Abstract: We present an optimal quantum algorithm for fidelity estimation between two
quantum states when one of them is pure. In particular, the (square root)
fidelity of a mixed state to a pure state can be estimated to within additive
error $\varepsilon$ by using $\Theta(1/\varepsilon)$ queries to their
state-preparation circuits, achieving a quadratic speedup over the folklore
$O(1/\varepsilon^2)$. Our approach is technically simple, and can moreover
estimate the quantity $\sqrt{\operatorname{tr}(\rho\sigma^2)}$ that is not
common in the literature. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
query-optimal approach to fidelity estimation involving mixed states.

Abstract: In this manuscript, we present a general and exact method for classicalizing

procedure to derive a classical Hamiltonian and a symplectic structure for the
Poisson brackets, yielding $N-1$ Hamilton's equations that precisely replicate
the quantum dynamics, including complex phenomena like entanglement. We
demonstrate the method's efficacy by classicalizing two interacting qubits in
$\mathbb{CP}^3$, exactly reproducing quantum observables such as quantum
probabilities, quaternionic population differences and the concurrence,
capturing entanglement dynamics via a classical analog.

Conclusion: 改进后的CCN方法在X态纠缠检测中更有效，扩展了其应用范围。

Abstract: The Computable Cross Norm (CCN), or realignment criterion, is a widely used
method for entanglement detection in quantum systems; however, it typically
provides only a necessary condition. In this work, we advance the applicability
of the realignment criterion by deriving a condition that is both necessary and
sufficient for detecting entanglement in two-qubit. $X$-states derive their
name from the characteristic 'X' shape of their density matrix, which contains
seven independent matrix parameters. Notably, they incorporate several
important subclasses of entangled states, including Bell states, Werner states,
and maximally entangled mixed states. $X$-states have proven highly useful in
entanglement studies due to their sparse structure and the ease with which
entanglement-related quantities can be computed. This refined criterion
improves the identification of entangled states that the standard CCN approach
fails to detect, thereby extending the utility of the method.

Abstract: This work focuses on optimizing the gates of a quantum circuit with a given
topology to approximate the unitary time evolution governed by a Hamiltonian.
Recognizing that unitary matrices form a mathematical manifold, we employ
Riemannian optimization methods -- specifically the Riemannian trust-region
algorithm -- which involves second derivative calculations with respect to the
gates. Our key technical contribution is a matrix-free algorithmic framework
that avoids the explicit construction and storage of large unitary matrices
acting on the whole Hilbert space. Instead, we evaluate all quantities as sums
over state vectors, assuming that these vectors can be stored in memory. We
develop HPC-optimized kernels for applying gates to state vectors and for the
gradient and Hessian computation. Further improvements are achieved by
exploiting sparsity structures due to Hamiltonian conservation laws, such as
parity conservation, and lattice translation invariance. We benchmark our
implementation on the Fermi-Hubbard model with up to 16 sites, demonstrating a
nearly linear parallelization speed-up with up to 112 CPU threads. Finally, we
compare our implementation with an alternative matrix product operator-based
approach.

Abstract: The information scrambling phenomena in an open quantum system modeled by
Ising spin chains coupled to Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (LMG) baths are observed via
an interferometric method for obtaining out-of-time-ordered correlators
($\mathcal{F}-$OTOC). We also use an anisotropic bath connecting to a system of
tilted field Ising spin chain in order to confirm that such situations are
suitable for the emergence of ballistic spreading of information manifested in
the light cones in the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC profiles. Bipartite OTOC is also
calculated for a bipartite open system, and its behavior is compared with that
of the $\mathcal{F}-$OTOC of a two-spin open system to get a picture of what
these measures reveal about the nature of scrambling in different parameter
regimes. Additionally, the presence of distinct phases in the LMG model
motivated an independent analysis of its scrambling properties, where
$\mathcal{F}-$OTOC diagnostics revealed that quantum chaos emerges exclusively
in the symmetry-broken phase.

Conclusion: POVM-SPT简化了SPT任务，尤其适用于大规模量子系统。

Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is crucial for advancing quantum
technologies, including quantum computers, quantum networks and quantum
sensors. Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map
QPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample
complexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT
relies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the
optimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key
factor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a
generalized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary
operators with generalized measurements (POVMs). This approach, termed shadow
process tomography with POVMs (POVM-SPT), uses convex optimization to identify
the optimal POVM for minimizing the shadow norm, thereby further reducing
sample complexity. We demonstrate the identification of the optimal POVM
through numerical simulations and provide the corresponding optimization
algorithms. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that POVM-SPT achieves a
substantial reduction in shadow norm compared to conventional SPT, with an
approximate 7-fold improvement for single-qubit input states and a remarkable
$2^{180}$-fold enhancement for 64-qubit input states. These results reveal that
POVM-SPT offers significant advantages in simplifying SPT tasks, particularly
for large-scale quantum systems.

Abstract: We investigate a two-qubit quantum system in contact with an environment
modeled by a microscopic collision model with added ancilla-ancilla collisions
in the non-Markovian regime. Two schemes of the two-qubit collision model with
carried-forward correlations are introduced. In one scheme, a single stream of
ancillae interacts with only one of the qubits of the two-qubit system; in the
other, both the qubits interact with two independent sequences of ancillae,
which could be at the same or different temperatures. The system's
non-Markovian evolution is examined using the trace distance measure, and the
non-classicality of the system is studied using the Wigner function,
non-classical volume, and concurrence. Also, interesting steady-state behavior
is observed when both the independent ancillae are kept at the same
temperature.

Abstract: Quantum field simulators provide unique opportunities for investigating the
dynamics of quantum fields through tabletop experiments. A primary drawback of
standard encoding schemes is their rigidity: altering the theory, its coupling
geometry, metric structure, or simulation time typically requires redesigning
the experimental setup, which imposes strong constraints on the types of
dynamics and theories that can be simulated. Here, we introduce the Optical
Time Algorithm (OTA) as a unifying framework, enabling the efficient simulation
of large classes of free quantum field dynamics using a single optical circuit
design that separates the time from the Hamiltonian's structure. By modifying
the parameters of the optical elements, our method allows us to engineer
timescales, coupling graphs, spacetime metrics, and boundary conditions,
thereby facilitating the implementation of relativistic and non-relativistic,
real- and complex-valued, short- and long-range quantum field theories on both
flat and curved spacetimes. We exploit the OTA's configurability to investigate
the spreading of quantum correlations in space and time for theories with
continuously varying coupling ranges. Relevant features predicted by quantum
field theory can be observed on systems of $10-20$ modes, which paves the
ground for experimental implementations.

Abstract: We provide a range of results on several groups of broad interest in quantum
information science: the Clifford group, the orthogonal group, the unitary
symplectic groups, and the matchgate group. For all of these groups, we prove
that analogues of unitary designs cannot be generated by any circuit ensemble
with light-cones that are smaller than the system size. This implies linear
lower bounds on the circuit depth in one-dimensional systems. For the Clifford
and orthogonal group, we moreover show that a broad class of circuits cannot
generate designs in sub-linear depth on any circuit architecture. We show this
by exploiting observables in the higher-order commutants of each group, which
allow one to distinguish any short-depth circuit from truly random. While these
no-go results rule out short-depth unitary designs, we prove that slightly
weaker forms of randomness -- including additive-error state designs and
anti-concentration in sampling distributions -- nevertheless emerge at
logarithmic depths in many cases. Our results reveal that the onset of
randomness in shallow quantum circuits is a widespread yet subtle phenomenon,
dependent on the interplay between the group itself and the context of its
application.

Abstract: We introduce a method to simulate open quantum many-body dynamics by
combining time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) with quantum trajectory
techniques. Our approach unravels the Lindblad master equation into an ensemble
of stochastic Schr\"odinger equations for a variational ansatz, avoiding the
exponential cost of density matrix evolution. The method is compatible with
generic ansatz\"e, including expressive neural-network wavefunctions. We derive
the nonlinear stochastic equations of motion for the variational parameters and
employ suitable Stratonovich numerical solvers. To validate our approach, we
simulate quenches in the locally dissipative long-range Ising model in a
transverse field, accurately capturing non-equilibrium magnetization and spin
squeezing dynamics relevant to trapped-ion and Rydberg atom experiments. The
framework is computationally efficient, scalable on high-performance computing
platforms, and can be readily integrated into existing tVMC implementations.
This work enables large-scale simulations of complex, dissipative quantum
systems in higher dimensions, with broad implications for quantum technology
and fundamental science.

Abstract: In a pure Gaussian tripartition, a range of entanglement between two parties
($AB$) can be purified through classical communication of Gaussian measurements
performed within the third ($C$). To begin, this work introduces a direct
method to calculate a hierarchic series of projective $C$ measurements for the
removal of any $AB$ Gaussian noise, circumventing divergences in prior
protocols. Next, a multimode conic framework is developed for pursuing the
maximum (Gaussian entanglement of assistance, GEOA) or minimum (Gaussian
entanglement of formation, GEOF) pure entanglement that may be revealed or
required between $AB$. Within this framework, a geometric necessary and
sufficient entanglement condition emerges as a doubly-enclosed conic volume,
defining a novel distance metric for conic optimization. Extremizing this
distance for spacelike vacuum entanglement in the massless and massive free
scalar fields yields (1) the highest known lower bound to GEOA, the first that
remains asymptotically constant with increasing vacuum separation and (2) the
lowest known upper bound to GEOF, the first that decays exponentially mirroring
the mixed $AB$ negativity. Furthermore, combination of the above with a
generalization of previous partially-transposed noise filtering techniques
allows calculation of a single $C$ measurement that maximizes the purified $AB$
entanglement. Beyond expectation that these behaviors of spacelike GEOA and
GEOF persist in interacting theories, the present measurement and optimization
techniques are applicable to physical many-body Gaussian states beyond quantum
fields.

Abstract: Quantum solutions to differential equations represent quantum data -- states
that contain relevant information about the system's behavior, yet are
difficult to analyze. We propose a toolbox for reading out information from
such data, where customized quantum circuits enable efficient extraction of
flow properties. We concentrate on the process referred to as quantum vortex
detection (QVD), where specialized operators are developed for pooling relevant
features related to vorticity. Specifically, we propose approaches based on
sliding windows and quantum Fourier analysis that provide a separation between
patches of the flow field with vortex-type profiles. First, we show how
contour-shaped windows can be applied, trained, and analyzed sequentially,
providing a clear signal to flag the location of vortices in the flow. Second,
we develop a parallel window extraction technique, such that signals from
different contour positions are coherently processed to avoid looping over the
entire solution mesh. We show that Fourier features can be extracted from the
flow field, leading to classification of datasets with vortex-free solutions
against those exhibiting Lamb-Oseen vortices. Our work exemplifies a successful
case of efficiently extracting value from quantum data and points to the need
for developing appropriate quantum data analysis tools that can be trained on
them.

Abstract: We investigate topological features in the synthetic Fock-state lattice of a
single-atom system described by the quantum Rabi model. By diagonalizing the
Hamiltonian, we identify a zero-energy defect state localized at a domain wall
of the synthetic lattice, whose spin polarization is topologically protected.
To address the challenge of applying band topology to the Fock-state lattice,
we introduce a topological invariant based on phase-space geometry-the
phase-space winding number. We show that the Zak phase, representing the
geometric phase difference between two sublattices, can also be computed using
a phase-space parameter and corresponds directly to the phase-space winding
number. This quantized geometric phase reflects the spin polarization of the
defect state, demonstrating a bulk-boundary correspondence. The resulting
phase-space topology reveals the emergence of single-atom dressed states with
contrasting properties-topologically protected fermionic states and
driving-tunable bosonic states. Our results establish phase-space topology as a
novel framework for exploring topological physics in single-atom synthetic
dimensions, uncovering quantum-unique topological protection distinct from
classical analogs.

Result: 发现RTN和OUN噪声允许量子行走在有限步数内实现状态转移和周期性。

Conclusion: 研究表明，即使在噪声环境中，状态转移仍然是可行的。

Abstract: In quantum communication, quantum state transfer from one location to another
in a quantum network plays a prominent role, where the impact of noise could be
crucial. The idea of state transfer can be fruitfully associated with quantum
walk on graphs. We investigate the consequences of non-Markovian quantum noises
on periodicity and state transfer induced by a discrete-time quantum walk on
graphs, governed by the Grover coin operator. Different bipartite graphs, such
as the path graph, cycle graph, star graph, and complete bipartite graph,
present periodicity and state transfer in a discrete-time quantum walk
depending on the topology of the graph. We investigate the effect of quantum
non-Markovian Random Telegraph Noise (RTN) and modified non-Markovian
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Noise (OUN) on state transfer and periodicity. We
demonstrate how the RTN and OUN noises allow state transfer and periodicity for
a finite number of steps in a quantum walk. Our investigation brings out the
feasibility of state transfer in a noisy environment.

Abstract: Microwave drives are essential for implementing control and readout
operations in superconducting quantum circuits. However, increasing the drive
strength eventually leads to unwanted state transitions which limit the speed
and fidelity of such operations. In this work, we systematically investigate
such transitions in a fixed-frequency qubit subjected to microwave drives
spanning a 9 GHz frequency range. We identify the physical origins of these
transitions and classify them into three categories. (1) Resonant energy
exchange with parasitic two-level systems, activated by drive-induced ac-Stark
shifts, (2) multi-photon transitions to non-computational states, intrinsic to
the circuit Hamiltonian, and (3) inelastic scattering processes in which the
drive causes a state transition in the superconducting circuit, while
transferring excess energy to a spurious electromagnetic mode or two-level
system (TLS) material defect. We show that the Floquet steady-state simulation,
complemented by an electromagnetic simulation of the physical device,
accurately predicts the observed transitions that do not involve TLS. Our
results provide a comprehensive classification of these transitions and offer
mitigation strategies through informed choices of drive frequency as well as
improved circuit design.

Abstract: The maximum entropy principle states that the maximum entropy among all
quantum states with a fixed mean energy is achieved only by the thermal state
of given mean energy. In this notes, we prove the maximum entropy principle for
quantum processes -- the entropy of a quantum channel with fixed mean energy is
maximum if and only if the channel is absolutely thermalizing channel with the
fixed output thermal state of that mean energy. This allows for an alternate
approach to describe emergence of the absolute thermalization processes under
energy constraints in the observable universe.

Conclusion: SQUASH攻击暴露了HQNN的关键漏洞，需设计更抗攻击的架构。

Abstract: We propose a circuit-level attack, SQUASH, a SWAP-Based Quantum Attack to
sabotage Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs) for classification tasks.
SQUASH is executed by inserting SWAP gate(s) into the variational quantum
circuit of the victim HQNN. Unlike conventional noise-based or adversarial
input attacks, SQUASH directly manipulates the circuit structure, leading to
qubit misalignment and disrupting quantum state evolution. This attack is
highly stealthy, as it does not require access to training data or introduce
detectable perturbations in input states. Our results demonstrate that SQUASH
significantly degrades classification performance, with untargeted SWAP attacks
reducing accuracy by up to 74.08\% and targeted SWAP attacks reducing target
class accuracy by up to 79.78\%. These findings reveal a critical vulnerability
in HQNN implementations, underscoring the need for more resilient architectures
against circuit-level adversarial interventions.

Abstract: We introduce a quantum channel to model the dissipative dynamics resulting
from the coupling between spin and motional degrees of freedom in chains of
neutral atoms with Rydberg interactions. The quantum channel acts on the
reduced spin state obtained under the frozen gas approximation, modulating its
elements with time-dependent coefficients. These coefficients can be computed
exactly in the perturbative regime, enabling efficient modeling of spin-motion
dephasing in systems too large for exact methods. We benchmark the accuracy of
our approach against exact diagonalization for small systems, identifying its
regime of validity and the onset of perturbative breakdown. We then apply the
quantum channel to compute fidelity loss during transport of single-spin
excitations across extended Rydberg chains in regimes intractable via exact
diagonalization. By revealing the quantum-classical crossover, these results
establish a bound on the maximum chain length for efficient entanglement
distribution. The quantum channel significantly reduces the complexity of
simulating spin dynamics coupled to motional degrees of freedom, providing a
practical tool for estimating the impact of spin-motion coupling in near-term
experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.

one-dimensional box, and the other particle is free. The free particle is
incident from the left with specified energy, and it may cause changes in state
of the confined particle before flying away to the left or to the right. We
present a non-perturbative formulation and computational scheme that determines
the probability of any such outcome, as a function of the initial state of the
confined particle and the energy of the incident particle.

Abstract: Obtaining accurate representations of the eigenstates of an array of coupled
superconducting qubits is a crucial step in the design of circuit quantum
electrodynamics (QED)-based quantum processors. However, exact diagonalization
of the device Hamiltonian is challenging for system sizes beyond tens of
qubits. Here, we employ a variant of the density matrix renormalization group
(DMRG) algorithm, DMRG-X, to efficiently obtain localized eigenstates of a 2D
transmon array without the need to first compute lower-energy states. We also
introduce MTDMRG-X, a new algorithm that combines DMRG-X with multi-target DMRG
to efficiently compute excited states even in regimes with strong eigenstate
hybridization. We showcase the use of these methods for the analysis of
long-range couplings in a multi-transmon Hamiltonian including qubits and
couplers, and we discuss eigenstate localization. These developments facilitate
the design and parameter optimization of large-scale superconducting quantum
processors.

Abstract: Given the ability to apply an unknown quantum channel acting on a
$d$-dimensional system, we develop a quantum algorithm for transforming its
singular values. The spectrum of a quantum channel as a superoperator is
naturally tied to its Liouville representation, which is in general
non-Hermitian. Our key contribution is an approximate block-encoding scheme for
this representation in a Hermitized form, given only black-box access to the
channel; this immediately allows us to apply polynomial transformations to the
channel's singular values by quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). We
then demonstrate an $O(d^2/\delta)$ upper bound and an $\Omega(d/\delta)$ lower
bound for the query complexity of constructing a quantum channel that is
$\delta$-close in diamond norm to a block-encoding of the Hermitized Liouville
representation. We show our method applies practically to the problem of
learning the $q$-th singular value moments of unknown quantum channels for
arbitrary $q>2, q\in \mathbb{R}$, which has implications for testing if a
quantum channel is entanglement breaking.
