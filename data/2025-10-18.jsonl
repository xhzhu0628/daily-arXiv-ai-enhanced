For sets of three unitaries, we first prove\nthat all maximally entangled states are equivalent in their performance as\nprobe. In the qubit case, we further establish that maximally entangled probes\nare always sufficient: if a set of three qubit unitaries is antidistinguishable\nwith either a single-system or non-maximally entangled probe, then it is also\nantidistinguishable with a maximally entangled one. However, in higher\ndimension, this equivalence fails.
