Classical features are extracted and reduced via Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to enable efficient quantum encoding. The reduced feature vectors are embedded into a quantum kernel-induced feature space using a fully entangled ZZFeatureMap and classified using a kernel based QSVM. Performance is first evaluated on a quantum simulator and subsequently validated on NISQ-era superconducting quantum hardware, specifically the IBM Torino (133-qubit) and IBM Fez (156-qubit) processors. Experimental results demonstrate that the QSVM achieves competitive classification performance relative to classical SVM baselines while operating on substantially reduced feature dimensionality. Hardware experiments reveal the impact of noise and decoherence and measurement shot count on quantum kernel estimation, and further show improved stability and fidelity on newer Heron r2 architecture. This study provides a systematic comparison between simulator-based and hardware-based QSVM implementations and highlights both the feasibility and current limitations of deploying quantum kernel methods for practical radar signal classification tasks."}

A central challenge is to distill these universal characteristics from model-specific ones. Random quantum states sampled from a uniform distribution, the Haar measure, provide a powerful framework for capturing this typicality. Here, we experimentally study the entanglement and symmetries of random many-body quantum states generated by evolving simple product states under ergodic Floquet models. We find excellent agreement with the predictions from the Haar-random state ensemble. First, we measure the Rényi-2 entanglement entropy as a function of the subsystem size, observing the Page curve. Second, we probe the subsystem symmetries using entanglement asymmetry. Finally, we measure the moments of partially transposed reduced density matrices obtained by tracing out part of the system in the generated ensembles, thereby revealing distinct entanglement phases. Our results offer an experimental perspective on the typical entanglement and symmetries of many-body quantum systems."}

We derive the Boltzmann distribution from a minimal differential scaling postulate and show that sustaining thermal equilibrium demands continuous photon exchange with average energy $\\langle hν\\rangle = 2.701\\,E_c$, quantifying the energetic throughput necessary to counter radiative losses. Entropy production is shown to arise naturally from inelastic photon scattering that converts high-energy photons into many lower-energy quanta, thereby increasing accessible microstates and driving irreversible evolution toward equilibrium. We establish physical criteria distinguishing genuine thermal equilibrium from purely formal temperature assignments and demonstrate that the classical notion of an infinite thermal reservoir emerges as an effective idealization within a hierarchy of dynamically maintained photon baths. This photonic framework complements phenomenological thermodynamics by providing its microscopic foundation and clarifies the physical meaning of temperature as an emergent collective property of photon-mediated energy exchange."}

This challenge is particularly severe in calibrating fault-tolerant, error-corrected circuits, where logical error probabilities are suppressed to higher order relative to physical noise and are therefore difficult to calibrate through direct logical measurements. Recently, Wagner et al. [PRL 130, 200601 (2023)] showed that, for phenomenological Pauli noise models, the logical channel can instead be inferred from syndrome measurement data generated during error correction. Here, we extend this framework to realistic circuit-level noise models. From a unified code-theoretic perspective and spacetime code formalism, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for learning the logical channel from syndrome data alone and explicitly characterize the learnable degrees of freedom of circuit-level Pauli faults. Using Fourier analysis and compressed sensing, we develop efficient estimators with provable guarantees on sample complexity and computational cost. We further present an end-to-end protocol and demonstrate its performance on several syndrome-extraction circuits, achieving orders-of-magnitude sample-complexity savings over direct logical benchmarking. Our results establish syndrome-based learning as a practical approach to characterizing the logical channel in fault-tolerant quantum devices."}

Since a CSS code is fully described by a chain complex, existing product formalisms are predominantly homological, defined via the tensor product of the underlying chain complexes of input codes, thereby establishing a natural connection between quantum codes and topology. In this Letter, we introduce the \\textit{quantum bootstrap product} (QBP), an approach that extends beyond this standard homological paradigm. Specifically, a QBP code is determined by solving a consistency condition termed the ``bootstrap equation''. We find that the QBP paradigm unifies a wide range of important codes, including general hypergraph product (HGP) codes of arbitrary dimensions and fracton codes typically represented by the X-cube code. Crucially, the solutions to the bootstrap equation yield chain complexes where the chain groups and associated boundary maps consist of multiple components. We term such structures \\textit{fork complexes}. This structure elucidates the underlying topological structures of fracton codes, akin to foliated fracton order theories. Beyond conceptual insights, we demonstrate that the QBP paradigm can generate self-correcting quantum codes from input codes with constant energy barriers and surpass the code-rate upper bounds inherent to HGP codes. Our work thus substantially extends the scope of quantum product codes and provides a versatile framework for designing fault-tolerant quantum memories."}

While traditional system identification attempts to reconstruct full system matrices (incurring exponential cost in the Hilbert dimension), we propose Quantum Spectral Filtering, a method that shifts the goal to improper dynamic learning. Leveraging the optimal concentration properties of the Slepian basis, we prove that the learnability of such systems is governed strictly by an effective quantum dimension $k^*$, determined by the spectral bandwidth and memory horizon. This result establishes that complex-valued LDSs can be learned with sample and computational complexity independent of the ambient state dimension, provided their spectrum is bounded."}

QEM strategies based on agnostic noise amplification (ANA) are intrinsically resilient to such noise variations, but their sampling cost remains a major practical bottleneck. Here we introduce a mitigation framework that combines virtual noise scaling with a layered mitigation architecture, yielding orders of magnitude reduction in runtime overhead compared to conventional zero-noise extrapolation post-processing. The proposed approach is compatible with dynamic circuits and can be seamlessly integrated with error detection and quantum error correction schemes. In addition, it naturally extends to ANA-based mitigation of mid-circuit measurements and preparation errors.

We also explore coupling a second, independent cavity mode to the atom, which increases the telecom emission rate and introduces quantum correlations between the cavity modes. A model for the hyperfine structure of a single cesium atom is then described and numerically integrated to demonstrate the viability of implementing the scheme with a modern cavity QED system."}

Two specific examples concern the transition from pure to mixed states in two different universality classes of dynamics in one dimension, one being the exponential model, the other the Dyson model, the dynamics of the latter exhibiting strong graphical evidence of quantum chaos, as a consequence of the results of Albert and Kiessling on the Cloitre function."}

Williamson"], "title": "Fast magic state preparation by gauging higher-form transversal gates in parallel", "comment": "16 pages, 5 figures", "summary": "Magic states are a foundational resource for universal quantum computation. To survive in a realistic noisy environment, magic states must be prepared fault-tolerantly and protected by a quantum error-correcting code. The recent discovery of highly efficient quantum low-density parity-check codes, together with efficient logic gates, lays the groundwork for low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computation. This motivates the search for fast and parallel protocols for logical magic state preparation to enable universal quantum computation. Here, we introduce a fast code surgery procedure that performs a fault-tolerant measurement of many transversal logic gates in parallel. This is achieved by performing a generalized gauging measurement on a quantum code that supports a higher-form transversal gate. The time overhead of our procedure is constant, and the qubit overhead is linear. The procedure inherits fault-tolerance properties from the base code and the structure of the higher-form transversal gate. When applied to codes that support higher-form Clifford gates our procedure achieves fast and fault-tolerant preparation of many magic states in parallel. This motivates the search for good quantum low-density parity-check codes that support higher-form Clifford gates."}

The present work investigates Dicke state superposition probes for quantum phase sensing under parameter encoding generated by one- and two-body interaction Hamiltonians. A class of N-qubit Dicke superposition states that exhibit near-Heisenberg scaling, of the quantum Fisher information, while maintaining significantly enhanced robustness to dephasing noise compared to GHZ, W-superposition, and balanced Dicke states, under unitary encodings generated by one-body interaction Hamiltonians are identified. For two-body interactions, Dicke superposition probes optimizing the quantum Fisher information are identified, and their performance under phase-damping, amplitude-damping, and global depolarizing noise is explored. Within this family, certain Dicke superpositions are found to combine super-Heisenberg scaling with improved resilience to phase damping relative to Fisher information optimal probes. These results establish tailored near-optimal Dicke-state superposition probes as versatile and noise-resilient resources for Heisenberg and super-Heisenberg quantum phase sensing governed by one- and two-body interactions."}

Recently, measurement-based implementations of photonic quantum memristors (PQMRs) have enabled tunable non-Markovian responses. However, their memory remains confined to local elements, in contrast to biological or artificial networks where memory is shared across the system. Here, we propose a scalable PQMR network that enables measurement-based memory sharing. Each memristive node updates its internal state using the history of its own and neighbouring quantum states, thereby realizing distributed memory. By modelling each node as a photonic quantum memtransistor, we demonstrate pronounced enhancements in both classical and quantum hysteresis at the device level, as well as enhanced network-level quantum hysteresis. Implemented as a quantum reservoir, the architecture achieves improved Fashion-MNIST classification accuracy and confidence via increased data separability. Our approach paves the way toward high-capacity quantum machine learning using memristive devices compatible with linear-optical quantum computing."}

These theoretical bounds characterise noise-induced margin decay and are validated via numerical simulations across multiple datasets, as well as experiments on real quantum hardware. We further justify the focus on margin-based measures by empirically establishing margins as a reliable indicator of generalisation performance for QSVMs. Additionally, we motivate the study of local depolarising noise by presenting empirical evidence demonstrating that the commonly used global depolarising noise model is overly optimistic and fails to accurately capture the degradation of generalisation performance observed in the NISQ era."}

Evaluations of various benchmark algorithms across multiple architectures show that TopoLS achieves an average 33% reduction in space-time volume over prior heuristic-based compilers, while maintaining linear compilation time scaling. Compared to the SAT-solver-based compiler, which provides optimal results only for small circuits before becoming intractable, TopoLS offers an effective and scalable solution for lattice-surgery compilation."}

Transmitting which via a d-level perfect quantum channel it is possible to communicate log d-bits of classical information. But what if the set of encoding operations is restricted only within a physically constrained class? Here, we consider such a class of encoding operations to be the set of free operations for any quantum resource theory and show that the constrained capacity - namely, the free encoding capacity (FEC) emerged as a unit of the corresponding quantum resource. Moreover, we show that for the pointed resource theories - a resource theory admitting only a single free state - FEC becomes a faithful resource measure also. We also discuss the implications of FEC in the question of resource-theoretic state transformations and the possibility of extending its faithfulness for general quantum resource theories."}

The gauge and matter fields are encoded directly in the degrees of freedom of the rotor variables associated with the circuit nodes, and Gauss's law emerges exactly from the conservation of local charge, without auxiliary stabilizers, penalty terms, or Hilbert-space truncation. A minimal gauge-matter coupling arises microscopically from Josephson nonlinearities, whereas the magnetic plaquette interaction is generated perturbatively via virtual matter excitations. Numerical diagonalization confirms the emergence of compact electrodynamics and coherent vortex excitations, underscoring the need for large local Hilbert spaces in the continuum regime. The required circuit parameters are within the current experimental capabilities. Our results establish superconducting circuits as a scalable, continuous-variable platform for analog quantum simulation of non-perturbative gauge dynamics."}

This product structure leads to the distinction between product states and entangled states; moreover, one can quantify entanglement by considering the distance of a quantum state to the set of product states. The underlying optimization problem occurs frequently in physics and beyond, for instance in the computation of the injective tensor norm in multilinear algebra. Here, we introduce a method to determine the maximal overlap of a pure multiparticle quantum state with product states based on considering several copies of the pure state. This leads to three types of hierarchical approximations to the problem, all of which we prove to converge to the actual value. Besides allowing for the computation of the geometric measure of entanglement, our results can be used to tackle optimizations over stochastic local transformations, to find entanglement witnesses for weakly entangled bipartite states, and to design strong separability tests for mixed multiparticle states. Finally, our approach sheds light on the complexity of separability tests."}

This approach enables systematic tuning of kinetic inductance, depairing currents, microwave dissipation, and mode structure within a single device. Bias- and temperature-dependent resonance shifts quantify disorder-induced modifications of the superconducting density of states through the nonlinear kinetic inductance, while the emergence of multiple resonant modes reveals the formation of electrodynamically distinct superconducting regions.
