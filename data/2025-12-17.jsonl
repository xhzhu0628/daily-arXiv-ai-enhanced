Specifically, we focus on Sauter-like pulse trains with random time delays between successive pulses, drawn from a Gaussian distribution wherein the extent of fluctuations is controlled by the standard deviation $σ_T$ of the distribution. We find that increasing $σ_T$ leads to a dramatic transformation in the longitudinal momentum spectrum. The well-known fringe pattern, akin to that in the multi-slit interference, gets significantly modified. The averaged spectra exhibit a robust Gaussian-like envelope with residual oscillations, which are much more prominent in the central momentum region. Notably, we find that in certain cases, stochastic time delays lead to a pronounced enhancement in the central peak of the distribution function for pulse train containing $N$ pulses. For example, for $N=20$ pulses, $σ_T \\approx 31$ $[m^{-1}]$(about $17\\%$ of the mean time delay) yields nearly a tenfold increase in the central peak, which for $σ_T \\approx 50$ $[m^{-1}]$ (about $27\\%$ of the mean time delay), scales up to $10^3.$ This may open up new possibilities for optimizing multi-pulse field configurations and guide future experimental designs aimed at maximizing EPPs creation."}

Our algorithm consists of two branches: spatial processing and time evolution. Regarding the spatial processing, the classical module encodes the local topological features of the road network based on the GCN method, and the quantum module is designed to map graph features onto parameterized quantum circuits through a differentiable pooling layer. The time evolution is solved by integrating multi-source contextual information and capturing dynamic trip dependencies on the classical TCN theory. Finally, our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms the current methods in terms of prediction accuracy and stability, validating the unique advantages of the quantum-enhanced mechanism in capturing high-dimensional spatial dependencies."}

Our construction encodes a logical qubit in the quantum double $D(G)$ of a non-Abelian group $G$ on a triangular spatial patch. The logical gate is implemented transversally by stacking on the spatial region a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase specified by a group 2-cocycle. The Bravyi--König theorem limits the unitary gates implementable by constant-depth quantum circuits on Pauli stabilizer codes in $D$ dimensions to the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. We bypass this, by constructing transversal unitary gates at arbitrary levels of the Clifford hierarchy purely in 2D, without sacrificing locality or fault tolerance, however at the cost of using the quantum double of a non-Abelian group $G$. Specifically, for $G = D_{4N}$, the dihedral group of order $8N$, we realize the phase gate $T^{1/N} = \\mathrm{diag}(1, e^{iπ/(4N)})$ in the logical $\\overline{Z}$ basis. For $8N = 2^n$, this gate lies at the $n$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy and, importantly, has a qubit-only realization: we show that it can be constructed in terms of Clifford-hierarchy stabilizers for a code with $n$ physical qubits on each edge of the lattice. We also discuss code-switching to the $\\mathbb{Z}_2 \\times \\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ toric codes, which can be utilized for the quantum error correction in this setup."}

This work proposes a scalable compilation strategy that \"searches smarter, not harder\". We introduce Iterative Diving Search (IDS), a goal-directed search algorithm that avoids the memory issues of previous methods, and relaxed routing, an optimization to mitigate atom rearrangement overhead.

The study introduces a general method for computing transmittance along a slant path between a satellite and an optical ground station, incorporating zenith angle, slant range, and altitude-dependent attenuation. The proposed framework is intended to support the design and evaluation of space-based optical links and serves as a critical tool for defining technical specifications in satellite communication demonstrators and simulations. Numerical estimates are provided to illustrate the magnitude of losses under typical operational conditions, including the role of aperture averaging. In addition to the link budget analysis, we introduce a satellite-based quantum use case.

Here we introduce a general framework for microwave-free vector magnetometry at near-zero field that leverages Bayesian inference to extract both the magnetic field vector and the NV orientation directly from photoluminescence maps. An analytical model of cross-relaxation resonances enables efficient inference under arbitrary field and orientation configurations, while naturally incorporating the discrete degeneracies of the NV symmetry. We experimentally demonstrate robust orientation determination and vector-field reconstruction, establishing a general route toward compact and alignment-free NV magnetometers for practical sensing applications."}

However, its application in qubit control is limited by residual intensity crosstalk at neighboring sites and by a nonzero background floor in the far wings of the addressing beam, leading to accumulated errors from many exposed qubits. Here, we present an all-optical scheme that mitigates both effects using a single digital micromirror device (DMD) operated in a double-pass configuration, in which light interacts with two separate regions of the same device. In the first pass, one region of the DMD is placed in a Fourier plane and implements a binary-amplitude hologram for individual addressing, while in the second pass a different region serves as a programmable intermediate image-plane aperture for spatial filtering. By multiplexing the Fourier-plane hologram to include secondary holograms, we generate weak auxiliary fields that interfere destructively with unwanted light at selected sites, while image-plane filtering suppresses the residual tail at larger distances. Together, these techniques maintain relative intensity crosstalk at or below $10^{-5}$ ($-50\\,\\mathrm{dB}$) across the full field of view relevant for qubit addressing, and further reduce the far-wing background to approximately $10^{-6}$ at large distances from the addressed qubit, approaching the detection limit. These results provide a compact, DMD-based solution for low-crosstalk optical holographic qubit addressing that is directly applicable to trapped ions and other spatially ordered quantum systems."}

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise."}

This framework encompasses several families of quantum codes, including stabilizer and subsystem codes, provides a natural extension of generalized distances in quantum codes, and yields new invariants that capture local algebraic and combinatorial features.

An exactly solvable rotating-wave benchmark links generator growth to interference-induced near-zeros of the coherence and shows how the reconstruction regulates the map. Applying the method to the unbiased spin--boson model reveals an emergent transverse measurement primitive: bath memory and counter--rotating terms induce phase lock-in that irreversibly erases the relative phase between $σ_x$ eigenspaces on a finite timescale $t_P$, yielding an effective zero-bias transverse ($σ_x$) measurement channel. The selected transverse basis is not assumed a priori; it follows from the reconstructed reduced dynamics.

This description is equivalent to assuming that the effective positive-operator-valued measurement (POVM) is diagonal in the measurement basis, and therefore completely insensitive to quantum coherences. We relax this assumption and derive a fully general expression for the observed measurement probabilities under arbitrary completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) noise preceding a computational-basis measurement. Writing the ideal post-circuit stat $\\tildeρ$ in terms of its populations $x$ and coherences $y$, we show that the observed probability vector $z$ satisfies $z = A x + C y$, where $A$ is the familiar classical assignment matrix and $C$ is a coherence-response matrix constructed from the off-diagonal matrix elements of the effective POVM in the computational basis. The classical model $z = A x$ arises if and only if all POVM elements are diagonal; in this sense $C$ quantifies accessible information about coherent readout distortions and interference between computational-basis states, all of which are invisible to models that retain only $A$. This work therefore provides a natural, fully general framework for coherence-sensitive readout modeling on current and future quantum devices."}

Here, we propose a low-depth quantum neural network architecture with linear scaling, inspired by memory-enabled photonic components, for variational entanglement engineering. The network incorporates physically motivated non-linear activation functions, enhancing expressivity beyond linear variational circuits at fixed depth. By Monte Carlo sampling over circuit topologies, we identify architectures that efficiently generate highly entangled pure states, approaching the GHz limit, and demonstrate a clear advantage of non-linear networks up to 20 qubits. For the noisy scenario, we employ the experimentally accessible Meyer-Wallach global entanglement as a surrogate optimization cost and certify entanglement using bipartite negativity. For mixed states of up to ten qubits, the optimized circuits generate substantial entanglement across both symmetric and asymmetric bipartitions. These results establish an experimentally motivated and scalable variational framework for engineering multipartite entanglement on near-term quantum devices, highlighting the combined role of non-linearity and circuit topology."}

Although the nuclei in these systems naturally lead to electron spin decoherence, they can be repurposed, if they are controllable, as long-lived quantum memories. Prior work showed that a metric known as the one-tangling power can be used to quantify the entanglement dynamics of sparse systems of spin-1/2 nuclei coupled to color centers in diamond and SiC. Here, we generalize these findings to a wide range of electron-nuclear central-spin systems, including those with spin > 1/2 nuclei, such as in III-V quantum dots (QDs), rare-earth ions, and some color centers. Focusing on the example of an (In)GaAs QD, we offer a procedure for pinpointing physically realistic parameter regimes that yield maximal entanglement between the central electron and surrounding nuclei. We further harness knowledge of naturally-occurring degeneracies and the tunability of the system to generate maximal entanglement between target subsets of spins when the QD electron is subject to dynamical decoupling. We also leverage the one-tangling power as an exact and immediate method for computing QD electron spin dephasing times with and without the application of spin echo sequences, and use our analysis to identify coherence-sustaining conditions within the system."}

To overcome this barrier, this paper introduces an efficient Frozen Gaussian Sampling (FGS) algorithm based on the Wigner-Fokker-Planck phase-space formulation. The proposed algorithm exhibits two transformative advantages. First, for the computation of physical observables, its sampling error is independent of the semiclassical parameter $\\varepsilon$, thus fundamentally breaking the prohibitive computational scaling faced by grid methods in the semiclassical limit. Second, its mesh-free nature entirely eliminates the boundary-induced instabilities that constrain long-time grid-based simulations. Leveraging these capabilities, the FGS algorithm serves as a powerful investigatory tool for exploring the long-time behavior of open quantum systems. Specifically, we provide compelling numerical evidence for the existence of steady states in strongly non-harmonic potentials-a regime where rigorous analytical results are currently lacking."}

In this work, we investigate a one-dimensional spin model featuring a tunable long-range hopping term, $H_{n}$, which introduces nonlocal interactions and bridges the gap between Hermitian and non-Hermitian regimes. Through a systematic analysis of level-spacing statistics, Krylov complexity, and entanglement entropy, we demonstrate that $H_{n}$ acts as a universal control parameter driving the transition from integrability to quantum chaos. Specifically, increasing the strength of $H_{n}$ induces a crossover from Poissonian to Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble statistics in the Hermitian limit, and similarly triggers chaotic dynamics in the non-Hermitian case. Most remarkably, despite the onset of global chaos, we identify a tower of exact nonthermal eigenstates that evade thermalization. These states survive as robust quantum many-body scars, retaining low entanglement and coherent dynamics even under strong non-Hermitian perturbations. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which long-range and non-Hermitian effects reshape quantum ergodicity, offering new pathways for preserving quantum coherence in complex many-body systems."}

It is about the decision-making behavior any individual agent should strive for, not a descriptive \"law of nature.\" Second, all probabilities, including all quantum probabilities, are so subjective they never tell nature what to do. This includes probability-1 assignments. Quantum states thus have no \"ontic hold\" on the world, which implies a more radical kind of indeterminism in quantum theory than other interpretations understand. Third, quantum measurement outcomes just are personal experiences for the agent gambling upon them. Thus all quantum measurement outcomes are local in the sense of the agent enacting them. Through these tenets, we explain four points better than previously: 1) how QBism contrasts with Bohr's concern over unambiguous language, 2) how QBism contrasts with the Everett interpretation, 3) how QBism understands the meaning of Bell inequality violations, and 4) how QBism responds to Wigner's \"suspended animation\" argument.

Typically, the theoretical modeling has been conducted in the Schrödinger picture, where results are only obtainable under certain approximations, while, in contrast, the Heisenberg picture has remained relatively unexplored. In this work, we develop an accurately controlled perturbative expansion of the time-evolution operator in the Heisenberg picture and derive beyond-semiclassical corrections to the emitter dynamics due to the coupling to the quantized electromagnetic field, capturing effects of the quantum fluctuations present in the latter. We focus on high-order harmonic generation (HHG), where the approach is accurate in parameter regimes of current interest and it gives closed-form expressions for key observables. This formulation not only simplifies numerical calculations compared to the Schrödinger-picture approach but also provides a clear correspondence between nonclassical features of the emitted light and the underlying induced dynamics of the generating medium including quantum fluctuations. Moreover, the Heisenberg framework naturally yields scaling relations with the number of independent emitters, enabling us to assess whether nonclassical behavior should persist under typical experimental conditions involving large emitter ensembles. Interestingly, we find that the degree of squeezing increases with the number of emitters, whereas the photon statistics approaches a classical Poissonian distribution in the many-emitter limit. We also find that the beyond-semiclassical emitter dynamics significantly enhances the degree of squeezing of the emitted light. Our work advances the theoretical understanding of quantum-optical HHG and introduces an accessible and well-controlled framework to describe realistic experiments."}

A crucial component of QNNs is the encoder, which maps classical input data into quantum states.

This process is further impeded by two key challenges: (1) the difficulty in evaluating encoded quantum states prior to training, and (2) the lack of intuitive methods for analyzing an encoder's ability to effectively distinguish data features. To address these issues, we introduce a novel visualization tool, XQAI-Eyes, which enables QNN developers to compare classical data features with their corresponding encoded quantum states and to examine the mixed quantum states across different classes. By bridging classical and quantum perspectives, XQAI-Eyes facilitates a deeper understanding of how encoders influence QNN performance. Evaluations across diverse datasets and encoder designs demonstrate XQAI-Eyes's potential to support the exploration of the relationship between encoder design and QNN effectiveness, offering a holistic and transparent approach to optimizing quantum encoders. Moreover, domain experts used XQAI-Eyes to derive two key practices for quantum encoder selection, grounded in the principles of pattern preservation and feature mapping."}

Here, we explore the DTC in a disorder-free, periodically kicked XXZ spin chain, which is stabilized by the Floquet strong Hilbert space fragmentation. We numerically show the period-doubling response of the conventional DTC order, and uncover a multiple-period response with beating dynamics due to the coherent interplay of multiple $π$-pairs in the Floquet spectrum of small-size systems. The lifetime of the DTC order exhibits independence of the driving frequency and a power-law dependence on the ZZ interaction strength. It also grows exponentially with the system size, as a hallmark of the strong fragmentation inherent to the Floquet model. We analytically reveal the approximate conservation of the magnetization and domain-wall number in the Floquet operator for the emergent strong fragmentation, which is consistent with numerical results of the dimensionality ratio of symmetry subspaces. The rigidity and phase regime of the DTC order are identified through finite-size scaling of the Floquet-spectrum-averaged mutual information, as well as via dynamical probes. Our work establishes the Floquet Hilbert space fragmentation as a disorder-free mechanism for sustaining nontrivial temporal orders in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems."}

The so-called exponential backlog problem that can arise when one has to do logical $T$-gates within the surface code demands real-time decoding of the syndrome information to diagnose the appropriate Pauli frame in which to do the gate. This in turn puts a minimum requirement on the communication rate between the quantum processing unit, where the syndrome information is collected, and the classical processor, where the decoding algorithm is run. This minimum communication rate can be difficult to achieve while preserving the quality of the quantum processor. Here, we present two decoders that make use of a reduced syndrome information volume, relying on a number of syndrome bits that scale only as the width -- and not the usual area -- of the surface-code patch. This eases the communication requirements necessary for real-time decoding."}

The protocol involves creating a maximally entangled n--qubit state, encoding the classical message with Pauli--Z and Pauli--X gates, and then transmitting and decoding the message via quantum communication, quantum operations, and measurements. The key novelty of this work lies in the proposed n--bit encoding routine, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first explicit and scalable recipe for constructing quantum circuits for n--bit Superdense Coding, minimizing errors through a simple circuit design. The protocol was tested on real quantum hardware using Qiskit 2.0 and the IBM--Torino quantum computer for message lengths of 4, 6, 8, and 10 bits. Results show that success rates decrease as message length, circuit depth, and gate count increase, largely due to increased Pauli--X gate usage for messages with more ``1\" bits.

This geometric distillation establishes a precise mapping connecting external control parameters directly to optimal measurement configurations. Crucially, a comparative analysis of the geometric angles against the principal eigenvalue spectrum, including its magnitude, susceptibility, and nonlocal gap, reveals a fundamental dichotomy in quantum criticality. While transitions involving symmetry sector rotation manifest as geometric criticality with drastic operator reorientation, transitions dominated by strong anisotropy exhibit geometric locking, where the optimal basis remains robust despite clear signatures of phase transitions in the spectral indicators. This distinction offers a novel structural classification of quantum phase transitions and provides a precision navigation chart for Bell experiments."}

While the global quantum state remains coherent, the observer's local reality becomes singular and definite. This work introduces reality steering, a protocol that allows an observer to probabilistically access a different reality already supported by the initial quantum state, without reversing decoherence on the environment. The mechanism relies on locally erasing the 'which-outcome' information stored in the observer's brain. Here, 'local' means operations confined to the observer's memory, excluding the environment, which may be cosmically large. Reality steering nevertheless faces intrinsic constraints: successful navigation requires coherent participation from the observer's counterparts across the relevant branches, and any transition is operationally indistinguishable from non-transition. After arriving in a new reality, all memory records are perfectly consistent with that reality, leaving no internal evidence that a switch occurred. This makes conscious confirmation impossible within standard quantum mechanics. We show that nonlinear operations beyond the standard theory could, in principle, enable verifiable and deliberate navigation. Our results shift multi-reality exploration from philosophical speculation toward a concrete -- though fundamentally constrained -- quantum-informational framework."}

Recently, a new approach has been proposed in the form of a quantum thermodynamic gauge theory, where the notion of redundant information arises from a group of physically motivated gauge transformations called the thermodynamic group. In this work, we explore the geometrical structure of quantum thermodynamics. Particularly, we do so by explicitly constructing the relevant principal fibre bundle. We then show that there are two distinct (albeit related) geometric structures associated with the gauge theory of quantum thermodynamics. In this way, we express thermodynamics in the same mathematical (geometric) language as the fundamental theories of physics.

Understanding the effect of hardware noise on these experiments is crucial to distinguish errors that have low impact, errors that can be mitigated, and errors that must be reduced at the hardware level. We ran a state preparation and energy measurement protocol on an ion-trap quantum computer, without any non-scalable off-loading of computational tasks to classical computers, and show that leakage errors are the main obstacle to chemical accuracy. More specifically, we apply adiabatic state preparation to prepare the ground state of a six-qubit encoding of the H3+ molecule and extract its energy using a noise-resilient variant of iterative quantum phase estimation. Our results improve upon the classical Hartree-Fock energy. Analyzing the effect of hardware noise on the result, we find that while coherent and incoherent noise have little influence, the hardware results are mainly impacted by leakage errors. Absent leakage errors, noisy numerical simulations show that with our experimental settings we would have achieved close to chemical accuracy, even shot noise included.

Two leading methods in solving the ground state problem are the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Adiabatic Quantum Computing (AQC) algorithms. VQE often struggles with convergence due to the energy landscape being highly non-convex and the existence of barren plateaux, and implementing AQC is beyond the capabilities of current quantum devices as it requires deep circuits. Adiabatically-inspired algorithms aim to fill this gap. In this paper, we first present a unifying framework for these algorithms and then benchmark the following methods: the Adiabatically Assisted VQE (AAVQE) (Garcia-Saez and Latorre (2018)), the Variational Adiabatic Quantum Computing (VAQC) (Harwood et al (2022)), and the Adiabatic Quantum Computing with Parametrized Quantum Circuits (AQC-PQC) (Kolotouros et al (2025)) algorithms.

This scaling is directly observable in the single-photon scattering spectrum, enabling the detection of minute changes in atomic separation with a figure of merit that scales as $ N^3 $. The quantum Fisher information (QFI) scales as $N^6$ and can be closely approached by measuring spectral shifts near the steepest slope of the most subradiant resonance.

Further for strictly non-interacting Hamiltonian, the direct relationship between ergotropy and correlations is established. Our results reveal that nonlocal resources invariably enhance extractable work under non-interacting Hamiltonians, while in the presence of interactions, their contribution can either increase or diminish depending on the structure of the state and the Hamiltonian."}

One of these difficult problems is the simulation of one-dimensional (1D) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, a major tool to learn about the structure of molecules, helping the design of new materials or drugs. Using advanced error mitigation and error suppression techniques from Q-CTRL together with the latest commercially available superconducting-qubit quantum computer from IBM and trapped-ion quantum computer from IonQ, we present the quantum Hamiltonian simulation of liquid-state 1D NMR spectra in the high-field regime for spin systems up to 34 spins. Our pipeline has a major impact on the ability to execute deep quantum circuits with the reduction of quantum noise, improving mean square error by a factor of 22. It allows for the execution of deep quantum circuits and obtaining salient features of the 1D NMR spectra for both 16-spin and 22-spin systems, as well as a 34-spin system, which lies beyond the regime where unrestricted full Liouvillespace simulations are practical (32 spins, the Liouville limit). Our work is a step toward near-term quantum utility in NMR spectroscopy."}

We investigate a transverse-field Ising chain as a quantum battery, focusing on the combined role of qubit interactions in the battery model and finite charging time. This interplay yields smoother and more controllable charging compared to sudden protocols or non-interacting batteries. Introducing stochastic noise reveals a strong dependence on the charging trajectory. Protocols that weakly excite the system gain energy under noise but lose extractable work. In contrast, protocols that strongly excite many modes show the opposite trend: noise reduces stored energy yet improves efficiency, defined as the ratio of ergotropy to stored energy. These findings demonstrate that finite-time ramps stabilize charging and highlight that noise can either hinder or enhance quantum-battery performance depending on the protocol."}

The execution of a circuit, however, depends on internal allocation and routing policies that are not observable to the user. A provider may redirect jobs to more error-prone regions to conserve resources, balance load or for other opaque reasons, causing degradation in fidelity while still presenting stale or averaged calibration data. This lack of transparency creates a security gap: users cannot verify whether their circuits were executed on the hardware for which they were charged. Forensic methods that infer backend behavior from user-visible artifacts are therefore becoming essential. In this work, we introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based forensic framework that predicts per-qubit and per-qubit link error rates of an unseen backend using only topology information and aggregated features extracted from transpiled circuits. We construct a dataset from several IBM 27-qubit devices, merge static calibration features with dynamic transpilation features and train separate GNN regressors for one- and two-qubit errors. At inference time, the model operates without access to calibration data from the target backend and reconstructs a complete error map from the features available to the user. Our results on the target backend show accurate recovery of backend error rate, with an average mismatch of approximately 22% for single-qubit errors and 18% for qubit-link errors. The model also exhibits strong ranking agreement, with the ordering induced by predicted error values closely matching that of the actual calibration errors, as reflected by high Spearman correlation. The framework consistently identifies weak links and high-noise qubits and remains robust under realistic temporal noise drift."}

We present a physics-informed neural network (PINN) framework integrating quantum mechanical constraints via adaptive weighting, a residual-and-attention-enhanced architecture, and differentiable Cholesky parameterization for physical validity. Evaluations on 2--5 qubit systems and arbitrary-dimensional states show PINN consistently outperforms traditional neural networks (TNNs), achieving highest fidelity across all dimensions. PINN outperforms baselines, with marked improvements in moderately high-dimensional systems, superior noise robustness (slower performance degradation), and consistent dimensional robustness. Theoretical analysis shows physical constraints reduce Rademacher complexity and mitigate the curse of dimensionality via constraint-induced dimension and sample complexity reduction, effective regardless of qubit number. While experiments are limited to 5-qubit systems due to computational constraints, our theoretical framework (convergence guarantees, generalization bounds, scalability theorems) justifies PINN's advantages will persist and strengthen in larger systems (6+ qubits), where constraint-induced dimension reduction benefits grow with system size. Practically, this advances quantum error correction and gate calibration by reducing measurement requirements from O(4^n) to O(2^n) while maintaining high fidelity, enabling faster error correction cycles and accelerated calibration critical for scalable quantum computing."}

While quantum optimization heuristics such as quantum annealing and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) are known to induce biased sampling, hybrid quantum-classical MCMC incorporates quantum dynamics only as a proposal transition and enforces detailed balance through classical acceptance steps. Using small Ising models, we show that MCMC post-processing corrects the sampling bias of quantum dynamics and restores near-uniform sampling over degenerate ground states. We then apply the method to random $k$-SAT problems near the satisfiability threshold. For random 2-SAT, a hybrid MCMC combining QAOA-assisted neural proposals with single spin-flip updates achieves fairness comparable to that of PT-ICM. For random 3-SAT, where such classical methods are no longer applicable, the hybrid MCMC still attains approximately uniform sampling. We also examine solution counting and find that the required number of transitions is comparable to that of WalkSAT. These results indicate that hybrid quantum-classical MCMC provides a viable framework for fair sampling and solution enumeration."}

A rigorous condition is established linking global separability to the behavior of pairwise entanglement, showing that the absence of pairwise entanglement is sufficient to guarantee complete separability of the system, provided the Hilbert-space basis is preserved. This result motivates the identification of the sum of two-tangles as a natural and effective entanglement quantifier for the W-class states. Furthermore, the commonly used $π$-tangle becomes ineffective for the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state as the system size increases, vanishing in the large-$n$ limit. To address this limitation, the sum of $π$-tangles is introduced, which, like the sum of two-tangles, successfully quantifies the entanglement of the maximally entangled $n$-qubit W state in the large-$n$ limit. In addition, a new condition for entanglement measures is introduced, which facilitates the formulation of a well-behaved and physically meaningful entanglement measure."}

This forms a new type of attack on the economics of cloud-based quantum computers. All major quantum computing companies today offer access to their hardware through some type of cloud-based service. Due to the noisy nature of quantum computers, a quantum circuit is run many times to collect the output statistics, and each run is called a shot. The fees users pay for access to the machines typically depend on the number of these shots of a quantum circuit that are executed. Per-shot pricing is a clean and straightforward approach as users are charged a small fee for each shot of their circuit. This work demonstrates that per-shot pricing can be exploited to get circuits to run for free when users abuse recently implemented mid-circuit qubit measurement and reset operations. Through evaluation on real, cloud-based quantum computers this work shows how multiple circuits can be executed together within a shot, by separating each user circuit by set of reset operations and submitting all the circuits, and reset operations, as one larger circuit. As a result, the user is charged per-shot pricing, even though inside each shot are multiple circuits. Total per-shot cost to run certain circuits could be reduced by up to $900$\\% using methods proposed in this work, leading to significant financial losses to quantum computing companies. To address this novel finding, this work proposes a clear approach for how users should be charged for their execution, while maintaining the flexibility and usability of the mid-circuit measurement and reset~operations."}

In many practical schemes, the initial qubit configuration has to be inferred from readout that is a time-dependent weak measurement record. However, a combination of the measurement scheme and intrinsic dynamics can end up scrambling the initial state and lose information irretrievably. Here, we study the information physics of quantum trajectories based on weak measurements in order to address the optimal achievable performance in qubit configuration readout for two realistic models of single qubit readout: (i) Model I is informationally complete, but without intrinsic dynamics; (ii) Model II is informationally incomplete weak measurements with intrinsic dynamics. We first use mutual information to characterize how much intrinsic information about the initial state is encoded in the measurement record. Using a fixed discrete time-step formulation, we compute the mutual information while varying the measurement strength, duration of measurement record, and the relative strength of intrinsic dynamics in our measurement schemes. We also exploit the emergence of continuum scaling and the Stochastic Master Equation in the weak measurement limit. We develop an asymptotic expansion in the measurement efficiency parameter to calculate mutual information, which captures qualitative and quantitative features of the numerical data. The bounds on information extraction are manifested as plateaux in mutual information, our analysis obtains these bounds and also optimal duration of measurement required to saturate them. Our results should be useful both for quantum device operation and optimization and also, possibly, for improving the performance of recent machine learning approaches for qubit and multiqubit configuration readout in current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) experiment regimes."}

Number of steps $N$ and number of ancillary qubits $n_A$ needed for actual implementation are crucial parameters of any such ASI. We show an achievable lower bound on the product $N.n_A$ and we determine in which situations this tradeoff is likely to be optimal. Contrary to common intuition we show that for quantum instruments which transform $n$ to $m(>n)$ qubits, there exist $N$-step ASI implementing them just with $(m-n)$ ancillary qubits, which are remeasured $(N-1)$ times and finally used as output qubits."}

In these results, we relax the output requirement of the quantum circuit to a single bit (i.e., no restrictions on input preservation/reversible computation), making our depth $2$ approximation bound stronger than the previous best bound of Rosenthal (2021). This also enables us to draw natural comparisons with classical AC$^0$ circuits, which can compute PARITY exactly in depth $2$ using exponential size. Our proof techniques further suggest that, for inherently classical decision problems, constant-depth quantum circuits do not necessarily provide more power than their classical counterparts. Our third result shows that depth $2$ QAC$^0$ circuits, regardless of size, cannot exactly synthesize an $n$-target nekomata state (a state whose synthesis is directly related to the computation of PARITY).

A 109, 052823 (2024)] that captured electron-photon correlations via an exchange-correlation functional derived from the nonrelativistic Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian and tested on one-electron systems, we use a simple procedure to compute a renormalization factor describing electron-photon correlations and inhomogeneity in the weak-coupling regime by comparing it with quantum electrodynamics coupled-cluster, and previous QEDFT optimized effective potential methods. Across various atoms and molecules, pxcLDA reproduces cavity-modified densities in close agreement with these references. The renormalization factor approaches unity as the system size or collective coupling increases, reflecting an electron-photon exchange-dominated behavior and improved accuracy for larger systems. This approach now offers a practical route to applying QEDFT functionals based on electron density to realistic electron systems."}
