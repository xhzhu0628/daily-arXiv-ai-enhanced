However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better\ndescribed by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to\npure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes.\nSince postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here\ninvestigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology\ncan survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a\nbulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number\nof the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we\nsystematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal\n(opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation\nfor this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian\nwinding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change\nsign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This\ntransition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect\nlocalization, is rendered invisible by postselection.

A Meta-Solver strategy implements\ndecomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum\nsubroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such\ndecompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines\nwell-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that\nare seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the\ntechnical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and\ndemonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof\nof concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of\nquantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to\nmake their performance competitive."}

This approach\nemploys energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be\nextracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by\nVQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and\nconvergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization.\nThus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve\nthe accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm\nwas implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty\nterm in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first\nstep focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted\npenalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of\nthe energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD\nand GateFabric ans\\\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively.\nk-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little\neffect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as\nelectron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially\nshows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially\nimproves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results\ndemonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective\nstrategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in\nvariational quantum algorithms."}
