Here, we propose two quantum algorithms to detect an\nimbalance in the triplet-to-singlet intersystem crossing (ISC) rates between\nexcited states with the same and different spin projections -- a necessary\ncondition for nonzero ODMR response. The lowest-cost approach evaluates whether\nthe evolution of an $S=0$ state under the spin-orbit coupling induces ISC to\n$S=1$, and also whether there is an imbalance in its intensity depending on the\nfinal state spin projection. The second approach works by comparing the\nemission spectrum of a spin defect with and without the spin-orbit coupling\noperator, inferring ISC intensity for different spin transition channels from\nspectrum intensity changes.

Our\nupper and lower bounds also hold for quantum state testing, where the goal is\nto test whether an unknown state is equal to a given state or far from it.\n  Our results are intriguingly optimistic and pessimistic at the same time. For\ngeneral states, the error is dimension-dependent and $\\gamma\\sqrt{d}$ in the\nworst case, meaning that only corrupting a very small fraction ($1/\\sqrt{d}$)\nof the outcomes could totally destroy any non-adaptive learning algorithm.\nHowever, for constant-rank states that are useful in many quantum algorithms,\nit is possible to achieve dimension-independent error, even in the worst-case\nadversarial setting."}

However, a\nunified framework for anyon mobility in SET phases with such diverse geometric\npatterns of symmetry supports has remained a major challenge. In this Letter,\nby introducing higher-order cellular automata (HOCA) -- a powerful computer\nscience tool -- to SET physics, we establish a unified approach for complete\ncharacterization of anyon mobility induced by the complexity of subsystem\nsymmetries. First, we design finite-depth HOCA-controlled unitary quantum\ncircuits, yielding exactly solvable SET models with Abelian anyons and all\npossible locally generated subsystem symmetries. Then, we present a theorem\nthat precisely programs all excitation mobilities (fractons, lineons, or fully\nmobile anyons) directly from the HOCA rule, representing the first complete\ncharacterization of anyon mobility in SET phases. As a corollary, this theorem\nyields symmetry-enriched fusion rules which govern mobility transmutation\nduring fusion. Fusion rules with multiple channels are identified, exhibiting\nnon-Abelian characteristics in Abelian anyon systems. Leveraging HOCA, this\nLetter opens new avenues for characterization of SET phases of matter and\nprogrammability of topological quantum codes."}

Appropriate challenges exist for factoring but those for\nelliptic curve cryptography are either too sparse or inadequate for standard\napplications of Shor's algorithm. We introduce a difficulty-graded suite of\nelliptic curve discrete logarithm (ECDLP) challenges that use Bitcoin's curve\n$y^{2}=x^{3}+7 \\pmod p$ while incrementally lowering the prime field from 256\ndown to 6 bits. For each bit-length, we provide the prime, the base point and\nan example public key. All challenges are generated by a deterministic,\nreproducible procedure. We calibrate classical cost against Pollard's rho\nrecords and quantum cost against resource estimation results for Shor's\nalgorithm. We compile Shor's ECDLP circuit to logical counts and map them to\nphysical resources for various parameters of the surface code, the repetition\ncat code and the LDPC cat codes. Under explicit and testable assumptions on\nphysical error rates, code distances, and non-Clifford supply, our scenarios\nplace the full 256-bit instance within a 2027--2033 window. The challenge\nladder thus offers a transparent ruler to track fault-tolerant progress on a\ncryptanalytic target of immediate relevance, and it motivates proactive\nmigration of digital assets to post-quantum signatures."}
