Here we derive a finite structured-bath\nHamiltonian in which dissipation and feedback originate from the same\nmicroscopic couplings. The resulting self-energy {\\Sigma}({\\omega}) exhibits\ncoupled real and imaginary parts whose evolution reproduces the breathing\ndynamics observed in Josephson quantum amplifiers. This establishes quantum\nreciprocity: macroscopic coherence lives not in isolation, but in structured\nconnection. We numerically validate this principle by engineering a six-qubit\nstructured bath to demonstrate controllable transitions from dissipation to\namplification. This architectural core serves as the foundation for a proposed\nmulti-scale workflow to transform quantum noise into a design resource,\npreserving coherence not through isolation but through architectural\nreciprocity."}

Despite its several\nbenefits, the classical FL is plagued with several limitations, such as high\ncomputational power required for model training(which is critical for\nlow-resource clients), privacy risks, large update traffic, and non-IID\nheterogeneity. This chapter surveys a hybrid paradigm - Quantum Federated\nLearning (QFL), which introduces quantum computation, that addresses multiple\nchallenges of classical FL and offers rapid computing capability while keeping\nthe classical orchestration intact. Firstly, we motivate QFL with a concrete\npresentation on pain points of classical FL, followed by a discussion on a\ngeneral architecture of QFL frameworks specifying the roles of client and\nserver, communication primitives and the quantum model placement. We classify\nthe existing QFL systems based on four criteria - quantum architecture (pure\nQFL, hybrid QFL), data processing method (quantum data encoding, quantum\nfeature mapping, and quantum feature selection & dimensionality reduction),\nnetwork topology (centralized, hierarchial, decentralized), and quantum\nsecurity mechanisms (quantum key distribution, quantum homomorphic encryption,\nquantum differential privacy, blind quantum computing). We then describe\napplications of QFL in healthcare, vehicular networks, wireless networks, and\nnetwork security, clearly highlighting where QFL improves communication\nefficiency, security, and performance compared to classical FL. We close with\nmultiple challenges and future works in QFL, including extension of QFL beyond\nclassification tasks, adversarial attacks, realistic hardware deployment,\nquantum communication protocols deployment, aggregation of different quantum\nmodels, and quantum split learning as an alternative to QFL."}

Furthermore,to counteract\ndynamic polarization disturbances in urban fibers,the system integrates\nqubit-based polarization feedback control,enabling real-time polarization\ncompensation through an automated polarization controller using data recovered\nfrom the qubit-based synchronization signals. During 12 hours of continuous\noperation, the system maintained a low average quantum bit error rate (QBER) of\n\\SI{1.12 \\pm 0.48}{\\percent}, achieving a secure key rate of 26.6 kbit/s under\n18 dB channel loss.
