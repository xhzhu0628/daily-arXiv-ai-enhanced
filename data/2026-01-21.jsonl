In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation framework, i.e., a digital twin, for continuous-wave wide-field ODMR in NV-center ensembles.

Modern deep-learning pipelines are the standard for interpreting radar returns effectively; however, they are often parameter-heavy and sensitive at low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), motivating compact alternatives like Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (HQNNs). A two-qubit HQNN is benchmarked against convolutional neural networks (CNNs) using a physics-informed 60GHz digital twin and real radar measurements under matched training protocols. In clean conditions, the HQNN achieves high accuracy (99.7% synthetic; 97.0% real) with up to 170x fewer parameters (0.066M). Its parameter efficiency is shown to be structural, as an ablation of the parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) causes sharp performance drops on real data (to 68.5% and 31.5% for the control heads). A domain-dependent sensitivity emerges under additive-noise evaluation, where the HQNN begins recovery earlier in synthetic data while CNNs recover more steeply and peak higher on real measurements. In label-fraction ablations, CNNs prove more sample-efficient on real Range-Doppler Maps (RDMs), with the performance gap being most pronounced (at 50% labels, BA 0.89-0.99 vs. HQNN 0.75). On synthetic data, this gap narrows significantly, largely vanishing by the 50% label mark. Overall, the HQNN's value lies in parameter efficiency and a compact inductive bias that shapes its distinct sensitivity profile; this work establishes a rigorous baseline for hybrid quantum models in privacy-preserving radar occupancy sensing."}

In this work, we systematically explore whether a Peres-type criterion can be established for EPR steering in the two-qubit system. Focusing on rank-2 (including rank-1) states and the two-qubit Werner state, we analyze the eigenvalues of their partially transposed density matrices and construct a significant steering criterion based on symmetric combinations of these eigenvalues. We prove that this criterion serves as a necessary and sufficient condition for steerability for the Werner state, all two-qubit pure states, all two-qubit rank-2 states. Furthermore, we validate the criterion for higher-rank states (rank-3 and rank-4) and show that the results align with known steering inequalities. Our findings suggest a more unified framework for detecting quantum nonlocality via partial transposition and open avenues for further theoretical and numerical investigations into steering detection."}

From quantum capacitance measurements, we extract power versus frequency spectra and fit Lorentzian line shapes to obtain the linewidth, amplitude, signal-to-noise ratio, and coherence time. The signal-to-noise ratio quantifies the ratio of the parity measurement signal to background noise and serves as an indicator of readout quality, while the coherence time characterizes the timescale for decoherence of the quantum state.

Our results demonstrate that Bell nonlocality and entanglement (Negativity) are highly sensitive to temperature and anisotropy, exhibiting sudden death under thermal noise, whereas MIN and UIN are significantly more robust. In particular, these discord-like and information-theoretic measures provide the largest baseline and persist even in parameter regions where entanglement vanishes, highlighting their suitability as a quantumness witness in realistic conditions.

It is shown that limit cycle steady state solutions, which are excluded by standard quantum mechanics, become possible in the presence of disentanglement."}

They characterize, respectively, the number of sites on which an operator acts nontrivially and the spatial extent of its support. We show that both the operator mass and length can be computed efficiently and exactly within a matrix-product-operator (MPS) framework, providing direct access to their full probability distributions, without resorting to stochastic sampling. Applying this approach to the disordered XXZ spin-1/2 chain, we find sharply distinct behaviors in non-interacting and interacting regimes. In the Anderson-localized case, operator mass, length, and operator entanglement entropy rapidly saturate, signaling the absence of scrambling. By contrast, in the many-body localized (MBL) regime, for arbitrarily weak interactions, all quantities exhibit a robust logarithmic growth in time, consistent with the known logarithmic light cone of quantum-correlation propagation in MBL. We demonstrate that this behavior is quantitatively captured by an effective $\\ell$-bit model and persists across system sizes accessible via tensor-network simulations."}

Existing decoders are commonly classified into two categories. Classical algorithmic decoders provide strong and well established baselines, but may incur substantial computational overhead at large code distances or under stringent latency constraints. Machine learning based decoders offer fast GPU inference and flexible function approximation, yet many approaches do not explicitly exploit the lattice geometry and local structure of topological codes, which can limit performance.

In sharp contrast, quantum teleportation displays an unavoidable, protocol-induced coherence cost that grows linearly with the number of teleported qubits and is independent of the input state. Through a stage-resolved analysis of the teleportation circuit, we separate protocol-generated coherence from message-dependent contributions and identify a universal two-bit coherence offset per teleported qubit at the maximal-coherence stage.

This situation represents one of the most important problems in the field of quantum information technologies. While existing data-driven methods struggle to generalize beyond the training data (extrapolation), physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) require predefined governing equations, which limit their discovery capability when the underlying physics is incomplete or unknown. In this work, we present the ParaQNN (ParaQuantum neural network) architecture, an equation-free framework for physical discovery. ParaQNN disentangles multi-scale dynamics without relying on a priori laws by employing a dialetheist logic layer that models coherent signal and decoherent noise as independent yet interacting channels. Through extensive benchmark tests performed on Rabi oscillations, Lindblad dynamics, and particularly complex ``mixed regimes'' where relaxation and dephasing processes compete, we show that ParaQNN exhibits a consistent performance advantage compared to Random Forest, XGBoost, and PINN models with incomplete physical information. Unlike its competitors, ParaQNN succeeds in maintaining oscillatory and damping dynamics with high accuracy even in extrapolation regions where training data are unavailable, by ``discovering'' the underlying structural invariants from noisy measurements. These results demonstrate that paraconsistent logic provides a structurally more stable epistemic foundation than classical methods for learning quantum behavior in situations where mathematical equations prove insufficient."}

We study this question in an arena where computation, learning, and causality collide. A twist on Grover's search that reflects about an a priori unknown state can collapse the query complexity from $O(\\sqrt{N})$ to $O(\\log N)$ over a search space $N$, i.e., an exponential speedup. Yet, standard quantum theory forbids such a unknown-state reflection (no-reflection theorem). We therefore build a state-learning-assisted architecture, called ``amplify-learn,'' which alternates the coherent amplitude amplification with state learning. Embedding this amplify-learn into the Bao-Bouland-Jordan no-signaling framework, we show that the logarithmic-round dream would open a super-luminal communication channel unless each round expends the learning-sample and reflection-circuit budgets scaling at least as $Ω(\\sqrt{N}/\\log N)$. In parallel, we derive tight computational learning-theoretic sample bounds for learning circuit-generated pure states, revealing a state-universal ansatz ``lock'' at order $N$ in the worst case. The dramatic closure is that no-signaling does not merely veto the unphysical primitive, but it fixes the only consistent reflection-circuit complexity, and feeding this causality-enforced complexity into the computational learning bound makes it collapse onto the very same $\\sqrt{N}/\\log N$ scaling demanded by no-signaling alone. No-signaling thus acts as a regulator of learnability: a constraint that mediates between physics and computation, welding query, gate, and sample complexities into a single causality-compatible triangle."}

By free, we mean that there is no potential within the interval and that its walls are penetrable; hence, the pertinent energy current density does not vanish at the walls. Certainly, quantization in an interval is not trivial because certain restrictions imposed by the domains of the operators involved arise. Here, our objective is to obtain the Hamiltonian for these particles. In practice, the Feshbach-Villars (FV)--free Hamiltonian is the proper operator for characterizing them and is a function of the momentum operator. Additionally, a Majorana condition must also be imposed on the wavefunctions on which these two operators can act. Thus, we start by calculating the pseudo self-adjoint momentum operator. A three-parameter set of boundary conditions (BCs) constitutes its domain. Up to this point, the domain of the Hamiltonian is induced by the domain of the momentum operator; however, we ensure that only the BCs for which the energy current density has the same value at each end of the interval are in its domain. All these BCs essentially belong to a one-parameter set of BCs. Moreover, because the FV equation is invariant under the operation of parity, the parity-transformed wavefunction is also a solution of this equation, which further restricts the domain of the free FV Hamiltonian. Finally, knowing the most general three-parameter set of BCs for the pseudo self-adjoint FV Hamiltonian for a 1D KFGM particle in an interval, we find that only two BCs can remain within the domain of the FV--free Hamiltonian: the periodic BC and the antiperiodic BC. These BCs are satisfied by both the two-component FV wavefunction, with these components being related, and the one-component KFG wavefunction, which can be real or imaginary."}

Quantum chaos is traditionally characterized by spectral properties of the Hamiltonian, most notably through the spectral form factor, while the hardness of classical simulation within the stabilizer formalism, commonly referred to as quantum magic, can be quantified by the stabilizer Rényi entropy. In this Letter, we propose a relation between the dynamics of the stabilizer Rényi entropy for thermofield double states and the spectral form factor, based on general arguments for chaotic systems with all-to-all interactions. This relation implies that the saturation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy is governed by a first-order dynamical transition. We then demonstrate this relation explicitly in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, using an auxiliary-spin representation of the stabilizer Rényi entropy that exhibits an emergent $Z_2$ symmetry. We further find that, in the high-temperature regime of the SYK model, the transition occurs at a finite time, with the long-time phase marked by spontaneous $Z_2$ symmetry breaking. In contrast, at low temperatures, the transition is pushed to times exponentially long in the system size. Our results reveal an intriguing interplay between quantum chaos and quantum magic."}

The platform is modular, where each three-mode optomechanical system serves as a fundamental building block. Operating independently, a single block achieves nonreciprocity for classical fields. Specifically, asymmetric radiation pressure from intrinsic optomechanical nonlinearity induces nonreciprocal mechanical displacement, modulating the cavity intensity through optomechanical feedback. This enables full isolation of backward transmission without requiring parameter initialization. Alternatively, for quantum signals, the platform is reconfigured by activating photonic and phononic exchange channels between the two blocks. In this configuration, nonreciprocity arises from quantum interference between direct photon hopping and indirect conversion pathways. Constructive interference enables unidirectional low-loss transmission, while destructive interference completely suppresses the reverse direction. After adiabatically eliminating the auxiliary modes, the optimal nonreciprocal frequency and the trade-off between insertion loss and nonreciprocal bandwidth can be controlled by engineering optomechanically induced mechanical dissipation. Additionally, the three-mode-based device requires less control-field power than two-mode systems under resolved-sideband conditions, demonstrating versatile potential for optical nonreciprocity applications across classical and quantum domains."}

Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\\to\\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation.

In this interferometric framework, we present entropic wave-particle duality relations between quantum coherence, characterized by the relative entropy of coherence of the quanton state, and which-path knowledge, quantified by the mutual information obtained through detector-state discrimination. By applying a general optimal discrimination measurement, which has a closed-form solution and encompasses other fundamental strategies as special cases, we provide an exact quantification of which-path knowledge in a variety of scenarios. This measurement is carried out in two steps. First, an optimal separation map with a prescribed separation level $ξ\\in [0,1]$ probabilistically reduces the overlaps between the input detector states with maximum success rate, or increases them in case of failure. Then, a minimum-error (ME) measurement discriminates either only the successful outputs (standard approach) or both the successful and failure outputs (concatenated approach). We show that the duality relation is tighter at $ξ=0$, where both approaches reduce to the ME measurement. For $ξ>0$, each approach yields a distinct relation that becomes less tight as $ξ$ increases, with the concatenated one providing the tighter bound. Finally, by using the discrete uncertainty principle, we determine the sets of detector states that lead to saturation of the duality relation, showing that they span $n$-dimensional subspaces of the detector space, where $n$ divides $N$. As a result, nontrivial saturation occurs only for interferometers with a nonprime number of paths. From the identified saturating sets, we highlight how the quanton-detector correlations underlie this phenomenon."}

Among randomly initialized models with identical architecture, approximately one-third show performance improvement under moderate noise, while a smaller fraction deteriorate and the remainder are marginally affected. We identify a strong negative correlation ($r = -0.62$) between baseline model performance and noise benefit, suggesting that noise acts as an implicit regularizer for under-optimized models while disrupting well-converged ones. The observed optimal noise level falls below theoretical predictions, indicating error cancellation in structured quantum circuits.

In the worst case, the number of states required for successful initialization grows polynomially with the code distance, but it has been shown that this can be reduced to constant ancilla overhead-in the best case, only four states are required. However, existing techniques for finding low-overhead initialization schemes are limited to codes with large symmetry groups, such as the Golay code. In this work, we propose a general, automated synthesis methodology for Steane-type fault-tolerant state preparation circuits that applies to arbitrary Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) codes and does not rely on code symmetries.

We analyze how the two main fusion operations, Type-I and Type-II, act on weighted graph states. Type-I fusion operates identically to the unweighted case, merging two one-dimensional weighted graphs, while preserving edge weights and success probabilities. In addition, the pool of 2-qubit weighted graph states can be generated easily by GHZ states or Bell pairs. In contrast, Type-II fusion requires a logical qubit, which can be formed only for specific weight configurations, and with success probability below one-half, which is an obstacle one can avoid. When successful, it fuses the states correctly, but its failure outcomes destroy the structure of the graphs, removing the good-failure feature, known from ordinary graph states. We compute the entanglement reduction of the resulting link due to the fused states being weighted graph states (for generalized fusion), and classify the resulting states of a general non-Bell projection. These results define the practical limits of the fusion-based construction of weighted graph states for MBQC."}

Instead of accumulating at the physical boundary, all eigenmodes become compressed and skewed within a finite spatial range determined by the inhomogeneous profile-a phenomenon we term the confined non-Hermitian skin effect. Consequently, the evolution of the probability distribution on the lattice starting from a single site is doubly confined: it is spatially bounded to a finite range by the inhomogeneous coupling, and further restricted to a one-sided trajectory at the edge of this range by the non-reciprocity.

Despite recent progress, a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental precision limits of continuous metrology with bosonic systems is currently lacking. We develop a general theoretical framework for quantum metrology with multimode free bosons under continuous Gaussian measurements. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic growth rates of the global quantum Fisher information (QFI) and the environmental QFI, which quantify the total information encoded in the joint system-environment state and the information accessible from the emitted radiation, respectively. We derive fundamental bounds on these quantities, showing that while Heisenberg-type scaling with the number of modes is attainable, the precision scales at most linearly with time and a meaningful energy resource. To illustrate our findings, we analyze several concrete setups, including coupled cavity arrays and trapped particle arrays. While a local setup yields a standard linear scaling with resources, a globally coupled setup can achieve the optimal quadratic scaling in terms of the mode number. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a nonreciprocal setup can leverage the non-Hermitian skin effect to realize an exponentially enhanced global QFI. Notably, however, this enhancement cannot be reflected in the environmental QFI, highlighting a fundamental distinction between the information stored within the joint state and the information radiated into the environment.

While satellite platforms have demonstrated thousand-kilometer entanglement distribution, quantum key distribution and quantum teleportation with ground, future constellations and deep-space missions demand photon sources that are robust, compact, and power-efficient. Integrated photonics offers a scalable solution, yet a critical spectral gap persists. Although telecom-band integrated photon-pair sources are well established, near-visible photons offer distinct advantages for satellite-to-ground links by mitigating diffraction loss and maximizing the collection efficiency of optical telescopes. Scalable integrated sources in this regime have remained elusive due to the fundamental challenge of achieving anomalous dispersion in materials transparent at visible wavelengths. Here we bridge this gap by demonstrating an integrated near-visible photon-pair source based on a wide-bandgap, ultralow-loss, silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$) microresonator. By engineering the dispersion of higher-order waveguide modes, we overcome the intrinsic normal dispersion limit to achieve efficient phase matching.

Measurement-free quantum error correction (mfec) replaces repeated measurements and classical feed-forward by coherent quantum feedback, but existing mfec protocols suffer from severe connectivity overhead when mapped to planar surface-code architectures: transversal interactions between logical patches require SWAP chains of length $O(d)$ in the code distance, which increase depth and generate hook errors. This work introduces a 3D stacked surface-code architecture for measurement-free fault-tolerant quantum error correction that removes this connectivity bottleneck. Vertical transversal couplers between aligned surface-code patches enable coherent parity mapping and feedback with zero SWAP overhead, realizing constant-depth $O(1)$ inter-layer operations in d while preserving local 2D stabilizer checks. A fault-tolerant mfec protocol for the surface code is constructed that suppresses hook errors under realistic noise. An analytical performance model shows that the 3D architecture overcomes the readout error floor and achieves logical error rates orders of magnitude below both standard measurement-based surface codes and 2D mfec variants in regimes with slow, noisy measurements, identifying 3D integration as a key enabler for scalable measurement-free fault tolerance."}

To this end, efficient single-photon sources and spin-photon interfaces have been implemented by integrating color centers or erbium dopants into nanophotonic resonators. However, the optical emission frequencies in this approach are subject to temporal fluctuations on both long and short timescales, which hinders the development of quantum applications. Here, we investigate this limitation and demonstrate that it can be alleviated by integrating the emitters into Fabry-Perot instead of nanophotonic resonators. Their larger optical mode volume enables both increasing the distance to crystal surfaces and operating at a lower dopant concentration, which reduces implantation-induced crystal damage and interactions between emitters. As a result, we observe a fivefold reduction of the spectral diffusion linewidth down to 4.0(2) MHz. Calculations and experimental investigations of isotopically purified 28-Si crystals suggest that the remaining spectral instability is caused by laser-induced electric-field fluctuations. In direct comparison with a nanophotonic device, the instability is significantly reduced at the same intracavity power, enabling a tenfold increase of the optical coherence time up to 20(1) microseconds.

The framework reproduces theoretical resource boundaries for Werner-like and Bell-diagonal states with fidelities exceeding ~98%, establishing adversarial learning as a lightweight yet effective method for constraint-driven quantum-state discovery.

Quantum amplitude encoding methods encode the multi-variate normal distribution in the amplitudes of a quantum state. This work presents the Quantum Box-Muller transform which creates a superposition of binary-encoded grid points representing the multi-variate normal distribution. The gate complexity of our method depends on quantum arithmetic operations and, using a specific set of known implementations, the complexity is quadratic in the number of qubits. We apply our method to Monte-Carlo integration, in particular to the estimation of the expectation value of a function of Gaussian random variables. Our method implies that the state preparation circuit used multiple times in amplitude estimation requires only quantum arithmetic circuits for the grid points and the function, in addition to a single controlled rotation.

Spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) is widely used to generate photon pairs for heralded single-photon sources, but intrinsic spectral correlations of the pairs often limit the purity and interference visibility of the heralded photons. Existing approaches to suppress these correlations rely on narrowband spectral filtering, which introduces loss, or exploiting different polarizations, which complicates on-chip integration. Here, we demonstrate a new strategy for generating spectrally separable photon pairs in thin-film lithium niobate nanophotonic circuits by harnessing higher-order spatial modes, with all interacting fields residing in the same polarization. Spectral separability is achieved by engineering group-velocity matching using higher-order transverse-electric modes, combined with a Gaussian-apodized poling profile to further suppress residual correlations inherent to standard periodic poling. Subsequent on-chip mode conversion with efficiency exceeding 95\\% maps the higher-order mode to the fundamental mode and routes the photons into distinct output channels. The resulting heralded photons exhibit spectral purities exceeding 94\\% inferred from joint-spectral intensity and 89\\% from unheralded $g^{(2)}$ measurement. This approach enables flexible spectral and temporal engineering of on-chip quantum light sources for quantum computing and quantum networking."}

Its applicability, however, is challenged by the existence of anomalous bunching, namely paradoxical situations in which partially distinguishable particles exhibit a higher bunching probability in two or more modes than perfectly indistinguishable ones. Using multimode bunching as a reliable criterion of genuine indistinguishability, therefore, requires a clear identification of the interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching can or cannot occur. In particular, since uncontrolled small time delays between single-photon pulses constitute a common source of mode mismatch in current photonic platforms, it is essential to determine whether the resulting photon distinguishability might lead to anomalous bunching. Here, we first identify a broad class of interferometric configurations in which anomalous bunching is rigorously excluded, thereby establishing regimes where multimode bunching-based validation remains valid. Then, we find that, quite unexpectedly, temporal mode mismatch does not belong to this class. We exhibit a specific interferometric setup in which temporal distinguishability enhances multimode bunching, demonstrating that time delays can induce an anomalous behavior. These results help clarify the conditions under which multimode bunching remains a reliable validation tool."}

We report bright heralded single-photon superradiance via spontaneous four-wave mixing in a 1-mm-long, high-density cesium vapor cell. By reducing the average distance between atoms in the atomic vapor to 0.29 times the idler photon wavelength, we observe a dramatic narrowing of the temporal two-photon wavefunction. This compression of temporal two-photon wavefunction evidences the superradiance of heralded photons in the collective two-photon emission dynamics.

A key innovation of DVQA is its use of the truncated higher-order singular value decomposition to preserve inter-variable dependencies without relying on complex long-range entanglement, leading to a natural form of noise localization where errors scale with subsystem size rather than total qubit count, thus reconciling scalability with accuracy. Theoretical bounds confirm the algorithm's robustness for p-local Hamiltonians.

Quantum-classical algorithms have been proposed to take advantage of both paradigms and to allow current quantum computers to be used in larger problems. In this work, a hardware-agnostic Benders' decomposition algorithm and a series of enhancements with the goal of taking the most advantage of quantum computing are presented.

In other words, we construct families of fully classical, i.e. commuting, measurements that nevertheless can be used to show contextuality of quantum theory. To overcome the apparent disagreement between the two notions of classicality, that is commutativity and noncontextuality, we propose a modified definition of generalised contextuality for continuous-variable systems. The modified definition is based on a physically-motivated approximation procedure, that uses only finite sets of measurement effects. We prove that in the limiting case this definition corresponds exactly to an extension of noncontextual models that benefits from non-constructive response functions.

The skin effect, induced by non-reciprocal dissipation, localizes relaxation modes near the system boundaries and gives rise to non-orthogonal spectral geometry. While such non-normality is often linked to slow relaxation, we show that it can instead accelerate relaxation through a two-step protocol - realizing a quantum Pontus-Mpemba effect. Specifically, we consider a one-dimensional open chain with coherent hopping $J$, asymmetric incoherent hoppings $J_{\\rm R} \\neq J_{\\rm L}$, and a controllable end-to-end coupling $ε$. For $ε=0$, the system exhibits the Liouvillian skin effect, with left and right eigenmodes localized at opposite edges. We compare two relaxation protocols toward the same stationary state: (i) a direct relaxation with $ε=0$, and (ii) a two-step (Pontus) protocol where a brief coherent evolution transfers the excitation across the lattice before relaxation. Although both share the same asymptotic decay rate, the two-step protocol relaxes significantly faster due to its reduced overlap with the slow boundary-localized Liouvillian mode. The effect disappears when $J_{\\rm R}=J_{\\rm L}$, i.e., when the skin effect vanishes. Our results reveal a clear connection between boundary-induced non-normality and protocol-dependent relaxation acceleration, suggesting new routes for controlling dissipation and transient dynamics in open quantum systems."}

Hydrodynamic equations, akin to transport equations for charge or heat, would be of great interest but face severe challenges because of the inherent nonlocality of entanglement and the difficulty of identifying conservation laws. We show that progress is facilitated by using information as key quantity related to - but distinct from - entanglement. Employing the recently developed \"information lattice\" framework, we characterize spatially and scale-resolved information currents in nonequilibrium open quantum systems. Specifically, using Lindblad master equations, we consider noninteracting fermion chains coupled to dissipative reservoirs. By relating the information lattice to a noise lattice constructed from particle-number fluctuations, we show that information is experimentally accessible via noise easurements. Similarly, local information currents can be obtained by measuring particle currents, onsite occupations, and covariances of particle numbers and/or particle currents. Using the fermionic negativity to quantify bipartite entanglement, we also study transport-induced entanglement and its relation to information currents. For a clean particle-hole symmetric chain, we find that information currents are shielded from entering the information lattice. Impurities or particle-hole asymmetry break this effect, causing information current flow and entanglement between end segments of the chain. Our work opens the door to systematic investigations of information transport and entanglement generation in driven open quantum systems far from equilibrium."}

In this work, we study optimal bounds for partial trace quantities in terms of the spectrum; equivalently, we determine the best bounds attainable over unitary orbits of matrices. We solve this question for Schur-convex functionals acting on a single partial trace in terms of eigenvalues for self-adjoint matrices and then we extend these results to singular values of general matrices. We subsequently extend the study to Schur-convex functionals that act on several partial traces simultaneously and present sufficient conditions for sharpness. In cases where closed-form maximizers cannot be identified, we present quadratic programs that yield new computable upper bounds for any Schur-convex functional. We additionally present examples demonstrating improvements over previously known bounds. Finally, we conclude with the study of optimal bounds for an $n$-qubit system and its subsystems of dimension $2$."}

LE exhibits universal finite-size scaling with critical exponents that match previous MIPT results and gives a nice operational interpretation connecting MIPTs to classical percolation. Remarkably, we find that LE decays exponentially with distance in the area-law phase as opposed to being essentially constant for the volume-law phase thereby, discover an intrinsic length scale $ξ_E$ that diverges at the critical measurement probability $p_c$. While classical percolation transition captures successful transport across a network, MIPT as characterized by LE can be interpreted as quantifying the amount of quantum teleportation between two given nodes in a quantum circuit. Building on this insight, we propose a two-ancilla protocol that provides an experimentally accessible readout of entanglement redistribution across the transition."}

They are designed to store quantum states and retrieve them on demand without losing features such as superposition and entanglement. Verifying that a memory preserves these features is indispensable for applications such as quantum computation, cryptography and networks, yet no general and assumption-free method has been available. Here, we present a device-independent approach for certifying black-box quantum memories, requiring no trust in any part of the experimental setup. We do so by probing quantum systems at two points in time and then confronting the observed temporal correlations against classical causal models through violations of causal inequalities. We perform a proof-of-principle experiment in a trapped-ion quantum processor, where we certify 35 ms of a qubit memory. Our method establishes temporal correlations and causal modelling as practical and powerful tool for benchmarking key ingredients of quantum technologies, such as quantum gates or implementations of algorithms."}

Paradigmatic examples often appear as quasiparticle towers of states, such as the maximally ferromagnetic spin-1/2 states, also known as Dicke states. A distinguishing feature of quantum many-body scars is that they admit multiple local \"parent\" Hamiltonians for which they are exact eigenstates. In this work, we show that the locality of such parent Hamiltonians strongly constrains the relative placement of these states within the energy spectrum. In particular, we prove that if the full set of Dicke states are exact eigenstates of an extensive local Hamiltonian, then their energies must necessarily be equally spaced. Our proof builds on recent results concerning parent Hamiltonians of the $W$ state, together with general algebraic structures underlying such quasiparticle towers. We further demonstrate that this equal spacing property extends to local Hamiltonians defined on arbitrary bounded-degree graphs, including regular lattices in any spatial dimension and expander graphs. Hamiltonians with $k$-local interactions and a bounded number of interaction terms per site are also encompassed by our proof. On the same classes of graphs, we additionally establish equal spacing for towers constructed from multi-site quasiparticles on top of product states. For the towers considered here, an immediate corollary of the equal spacing property is that any state initialized entirely within the quantum many-body scar manifold exhibits completely frozen entanglement dynamics under any local Hamiltonian for which those scars are exact eigenstates. Overall, our results reveal a stringent interplay between locality and the structure of quantum many-body scars."}

Diaz", "Martin Larocca", "Maria Schuld", "M. Cerezo"], "title": "Group Fourier filtering of quantum resources in quantum phase space", "comment": "18 + 5 pages, 3 figures", "summary": "Recently, it has been shown that group Fourier analysis of quantum states, i.e., decomposing them into the irreducible representations (irreps) of a symmetry group, enables new ways to characterize their resourcefulness. Given that quantum phase spaces (QPSs) provide an alternative description of quantum systems, and thus of the group's representation, one may wonder how such harmonic analysis changes. In this work we show that for general compact Lie-group quantum resource theories (QRTs), the entire family of Stratonovich-Weyl quantum phase space representations-characterized by the Cahill-Glauber parameter $s$-has a clear resource-theoretic and signal-processing meaning. Specifically, changing $s$ implements a group Fourier filter that can be continuously tuned to favor low-dimensional irreps where free states have most of their support ($s=-1$), leave the spectrum unchanged ($s=0$), or highlight resourceful, high-dimensional irreps ($s=1$). As such, distinct QPSs constitute veritable group Fourier filters for resources. Moreover, we show that the norms of the QRT's free state Fourier components completely characterize all QPSs. Finally, we uncover an $s$-duality relating the phase space spectra of free states and typical (Haar-random) highly resourceful states through a shift in $s$. Overall, our results provide a new interpretation of QPSs and promote them to a signal-processing framework for diagnosing, filtering, and visualizing quantum resources."}

We compare different architectures, from fully connected neural networks to transformers, and we test different design/training modalities, identifying sequence-to-sequence, attention-based models as the most effective on our datasets. These models consistently produce mitigated distributions that are closer to the ideal outputs when tested on both simulated and real device data obtained from IBM superconducting quantum processing units (QPU) up to five qubits. Across several different circuit depths, our approach outperforms other baseline error mitigation techniques. We perform a series of ablation studies to examine: how different input features (circuit, device properties, noisy output statistics) affect performance; cross-dataset generalization across circuit families; and transfer learning to a different IBM QPU. We observe that generalization performance across similar devices with the same architecture works effectively, without needing to fully retrain models."}
