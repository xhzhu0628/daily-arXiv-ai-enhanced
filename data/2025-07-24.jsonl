Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ECQCO achieves a\nTVD of up to 0.7 and a normalized GED of 0.88, enhancing compilation-stage\nsecurity. Moreover, it introduces only a slight increase in circuit depth,\nwhile keeping the average fidelity change within 1%, thus achieving a practical\nbalance between security and efficiency."}

Traditional approaches often rely on nonlinear least-squares\nfitting, which can suffer from limited robustness to signal decay and\ntime-dependent frequency shifts. By contrast, our EKS-based method captures\nboth amplitude and frequency variations with minimal tuning, adapting\nautomatically to fluctuations via an expectation-maximization algorithm.\n  We benchmark the technique in extensive simulations that emulate realistic\nspin precession signals with exponentially decaying amplitudes and noisy\nfrequency drifts. Compared to least-squares fits with fixed block lengths, EKS\nsystematically reduces estimation errors, particularly when frequencies evolve\nor signal-to-noise ratios are moderate to high. We further validate these\nfindings with experimental data from a free-precession decay $^3$He\nmagnetometer.\n  Our results indicate that EKS-based analysis can substantially improve\nprecision in nuclear magnetic resonance-based magnetometry, where accurate\nfrequency estimation underpins absolute field determinations. This versatile\napproach promises to enhance the stability and accuracy of future\nhigh-precision measurements."}

The main building blocks of these\nalgorithms (among them, the definition of the Hamiltonian and of the ansatz,\nthe optimizer) define a relatively large parameter space, making the comparison\nof results and performance between different approaches and software simulators\ncumbersome and prone to errors. In this paper, we employ a generic description\nof the problem, in terms of both Hamiltonian and ansatz, to port a problem\ndefinition consistently among different simulators. Three use cases of\nrelevance for current quantum hardware (ground state calculation for the\nHydrogen molecule, MaxCut, Travelling Salesman Problem) have been run on a set\nof HPC systems and software simulators to study the dependence of performance\non the runtime environment, the scalability of the simulation codes and the\nmutual agreement of the physical results, respectively. The results show that\nour toolchain can successfully translate a problem definition between different\nsimulators. On the other hand, variational algorithms are limited in their\nscaling by the long runtimes with respect to their memory footprint, so they\nexpose limited parallelism to computation. This shortcoming is partially\nmitigated by using techniques like job arrays. The potential of the parser tool\nfor exploring HPC performance and comparisons of results of variational\nalgorithm simulations is highlighted."}

For ideal, fully coherent evolution, we show that the unitary\ncan be reconstructed from two mixed states or $d+1$ pure states, where $d$ is\nthe size of Hilbert space. The reconstruction method can be extended to\napproximate the unitary part of a dynamical map, provided the decoherence is\nnot too strong to render this question meaningless. We exemplify the method for\nthe example of the cross-resonance gate as well as a random set of unitaries,\ncomparing the reconstruction from pure, respectively mixed, states to an\napproach based on the Choi matrix. We find that the pure state reconstruction\nrequires the least amount of resources when the dynamics is close to unitary,\nwhereas the mixed state approach outperforms the pure state reconstruction in\nterms of channel uses for appreciable decoherence."}

We find that the number of\nvariational parameters in the parameterized quantum circuit approaches the\nnumber of free parameters in the input matrices, depending on whether they are\nreal, complex and/or hermitian. Additionally, symmetries present in the input\nmatrix can be incorporated into the ansatz circuit, reducing the parameter\ncount further and making optimization possible for up to n=8 qubits.

If one repeatedly measures the\nposition of a particle (or a cannonball!) that has yet to arrive at a detector,\nthe Zeno effect will repeatedly collapse its wavefunction away from it: the\nparticle never arrives. Here we introduce quantum stroboscopic measurements\nwhere we accumulate statistics of projective position measurements, performed\non different copies of the system at different times, to obtain a\ntime-of-arrival distribution. We show that, under appropriate limits, this\ngives the same statistics as time measurements of conventional ``always on''\nparticle detectors, that bypass Mielnik's argument using non-projective, weak\ncontinuous measurements. In addition to time of arrival, quantum stroboscopy\ncan describe distributions of general time measurements."}
