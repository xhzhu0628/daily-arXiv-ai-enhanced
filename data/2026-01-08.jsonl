We then show how this schema dissolves the so-called measurement problem, along with the associated knowledge-information and macro-micro dichotomies, issues historically raised within later monistic or universalist philosophical settings that ultimately depart from the traditional Copenhagen spirit."}

Consequently, the ability to prepare high-quality cat states at large fault distances is essential. While optimizations for low fault distances or small numbers of qubits exist, higher fault distances can be achieved via generalized constructions with potentially suboptimal circuit sizes. In this work, we propose a cat state preparation scheme based on preparing two cat states with low-depth circuits, followed by a transversal CNOT and measurement of one of the states. This scheme prepares $w$-qubit cat states fault-tolerantly up to fault distances of $9$ using $\\lceil\\log_2 w\\rceil+1$ depth and at most $3w-2$ CNOTs and $2w$ qubits. We discuss that the combinatorially challenging aspect of this construction is the precise wiring of the transversal CNOT and propose three methods for finding these: two based on Satisfiability Modulo Theory solving and one heuristic search based on a local repair strategy. Numerical evaluations show that our circuits achieve a high fault-distance while requiring fewer resources as generalized constructions."}

By replacing conventional momenta with Dunkl momenta and allowing arbitrary time dependence in both, mass and frequency, we derive a deformed Pauli Hamiltonian that encodes reflection symmetries and topological gauge phases. Employing the Lewis-Riesenfeld invariant method, we derive exact expressions for the eigenvalues and spinor eigenfunctions of the system. Crucially, the AB flux imposes symmetry constraints on the Dunkl parameters of the form $ν_1 = \\mp ν_2 $, linking the reflection symmetry ($ε= \\pm 1 $) to the quantization of angular momentum. These constraints modify the energy spectrum and wavefunctions of the angular operator and the invariant operator. Our framework reveals novel spectral characteristics arising from the interplay between topology and Dunkl symmetry, with potential implications for quantum simulation in engineered systems such as cold atoms and quantum dots."}

Previous studies were limited to the zero-temperature, weak-coupling regime, where the rotating-wave approximation applies and only single-phonon processes contribute. Here we go beyond these limits using the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM). We show that HEOM accurately captures the exact dynamics at zero temperature and weak coupling, whereas perturbative Redfield theory fails due to long bath memory times. The non-Markovian effects persist at finite temperatures. In the strong-coupling regime, they are further enhanced, and we observe bound-state formation at zero temperature with only two coupling points. These results establish giant atoms as a powerful platform for exploring non-Markovian open quantum dynamics and their applications in quantum information and thermodynamics."}

This paramp, which amplifies signals in both parts at room and cryogenic temperatures, can be used to generate both the two-mode and single-mode squeezing of either system. It requires merely modulating the frequency of the spin ensemble at the sum of the cavity and spin frequencies (providing the classical pump) with the two systems sufficiently detuned. This effect is remarkable given that modulating a spin ensemble by itself produces neither amplification nor squeezing, unlike modulating an oscillator, and that an off-resonant perturbative analysis would suggest that modulating the spin ensemble merely parametrically drives the cavity mode. With typical cavity parameters including a cavity quality factor~$Q=10^4$, and a 1 GHz modulation amplitude, the microwave signal can be amplified by approximately $18~\\mbox{dB}$ in $1.7~\\mbox{$μ$s}$, with a resonant bandwidth of about $0.5~\\mbox{MHz}$.

The effect of squeezing depends critically on the system's symmetry and parameters. When the squeezing operator breaks particle-hole symmetry (PHS), DQPTs become highly tunable, allowing one to either induce transitions within a single phase or suppress them. Remarkably, when PHS is preserved and the squeezing strength reaches $r=π/4$, a universal class of DQPTs emerges, independent of the quench path. This universality is characterized by two key features: (i) the collapse of all Fisher zeros onto the real-time axis, and (ii) the saturation of intermode entanglement to its maximum in each $(k,-k)$ modes. Moreover, the critical momenta governing the DQPTs coincide exactly with the modes attaining the maximal entanglement. At this universal point, the dynamical phase vanishes, leading to a purely geometric evolution marked by $π$-jumps in the Pancharatnam geometric phase. Our work establishes initial-state squeezing as a versatile tool for tailoring far-from-equilibrium criticality and reveals a direct link between entanglement saturation and universal nonanalytic dynamics."}

An approach to alleviating these demands is provided by adaptive measurement strategies, which can yield up to a quadratic improvement in reconstruction accuracy for pure states by dynamically optimizing measurement settings during data acquisition. A key open question is whether these asymptotic advantages remain in realistic experiments, where readout is inevitably noisy. In this work, we analyze the impact of readout noise on adaptive quantum state tomography with readout-error mitigation, focusing on the challenging regime of reconstructing pure states using mixed-state estimators. Using analytical arguments based on Fisher information optimization and extensive numerical simulations using Bayesian inference, we show that any nonzero readout noise eliminates the asymptotic quadratic scaling advantage of adaptive strategies. We numerically investigate the behavior for finite measurement statistics for single- and two-qubit systems with exact readout-error mitigation and find a gradual transition from ideal to sub-optimal scaling. We furthermore investigate realistic scenarios where detector tomography is performed with a limited number of state copies for calibration, showing that insufficient detector characterization leads to estimator bias and limited reconstruction accuracy. Although our result imposes an upper bound on the reconstruction accuracy that can be achieved with adaptive strategies, we nevertheless observe numerically a constant-factor gain in reconstruction accuracy, which becomes larger as the readout noise decreases. This indicates potential practical benefits in using adaptive measurement strategies in well-calibrated experiments."}

However, the maximum switching rate is limited by phase diffusion: at high repetition rates, residual photons in the cavity seed subsequent pulses, leading to phase correlations, which degrade randomness. We present a method to overcome this limitation by employing an external source of spontaneous emission in conjunction with the laser. Our results show that this approach effectively removes interpulse phase correlations and restores phase randomization at repetition rates as high as 10 GHz. This technique opens new opportunities for high-rate quantum key distribution and quantum random number generation."}

However, while post-processing of Nb- and Ta-based resonators has been widely explored, primarily focusing on oxide removal using buffered oxide etch (BOE), post-treatment strategies for Al resonators remain underdeveloped. This challenge becomes particularly relevant for industry-scale fabrication with multichip bonding, where delays between sample preparation and cooldown require surface treatments that preserve low dielectric loss during extended exposure to ambient conditions. In this work, we investigate surface modification approaches for Al resonators subjected to a 24-hour delay prior to cryogenic measurement. Passivation using self-limiting oxygen and fluorine chemistries was evaluated utilizing different plasma processes. Remote oxygen plasma treatment reduced dielectric losses, in contrast to direct plasma, likely due to additional ashing of residual resist despite the formation of a thicker oxide layer on both Si and Al surfaces. A fluorine-based plasma process was developed that passivated the Al surface with fluorine for subsequent BOE treatment. However, increasing fluorine incorporation in the aluminum oxide correlated with higher loss, identifying fluorine as an unsuitable passivation material for Al resonators. Finally, selective oxide removal using HF vapor and phosphoric acid was assessed for surface preparation. HF vapor selectively etched SiO2 while preserving Al2O3, whereas phosphoric acid exhibited the opposite selectivity. Sequential application of both etches yielded dielectric losses as low as $δ_\\mathrm{LP} = 5.2 \\times 10^{-7}$ ($Q\\mathrm{i} \\approx 1.9\\,\\mathrm{M}$) in the single photon regime, demonstrating a promising pathway for robust Al-based resonator fabrication."}

The system is first discretized in a finite box with periodic boundary conditions, and the formalism in real time is verified by employing a contact interaction potential with exact solutions. Quantum circuits are then designed and constructed to implement the formalism on current quantum computing architectures. To overcome the fast oscillatory behavior of the integrated correlation functions in real-time simulation, different methods of post-data analysis are proposed and discussed. Test results on IBM hardware show that good agreement can be achieved with two qubits, but complete failure ensues with three qubits due to two-qubit gate operation errors and thermal relaxation errors."}

These interferometers exhibit two main advantages. First, they enable probing a sample at a chosen wavelength while detecting light at a different wavelength with high efficiency (bicolor quantum imaging and sensing with undetected light). Second, they can show quantum-enhanced sensitivities below the shot-noise limit, potentially reaching Heisenberg-limited precision in parameter estimation. Here, we compare three quantum-imaging configurations using only easily accessible intensity-based measurements for phase estimation: a Yurke-type SU(1,1) interferometer, a Mandel-type induced-coherence interferometer, and a hybrid scheme that continuously interpolates between them. While an ideal Yurke interferometer can exhibit Heisenberg scaling, this advantage is known to be fragile under realistic detection constraints and in the presence of loss. We demonstrate that differential intensity detection in the Mandel interferometer provides the highest and most robust phase sensitivity among the considered schemes, reaching but not surpassing the shot-noise limit, even in the presence of loss. Intensity measurements in a Yurke-type configuration can achieve genuine sub-shot-noise sensitivity under balanced losses and moderate gain; however, their performance degrades in realistic high-gain regimes. Consequently, in this regime, the Mandel configuration with differential detection outperforms the Yurke-type setup and constitutes the most robust approach for phase estimation."}
