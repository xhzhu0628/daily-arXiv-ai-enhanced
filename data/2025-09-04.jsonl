Unfortunately, the currently available Noisy\nIntermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) hardware is still heavily affected by noise.\nMany optimization techniques have been developed to reduce the negative effects\nthereof, which, however, only works up to a certain point. Therefore, scaling\nquantum applications from currently considered small research examples to\nindustrial applications requires error-correction techniques to execute quantum\ncircuits in a fault-tolerant fashion and enter the Fault-Tolerant Quantum\nComputing (FTQC) era. These error-correction techniques introduce dramatic\nqubit overheads, leading to the requirement of tens of thousands of qubits\nalready for toy-sized examples. Hence, quantum circuit optimization that\nreduces qubit overheads when shifting from the NISQ to the FTQC era is\nessential. This raises the question, whether we need to start from scratch, or\nwhether current state-of-the-art optimization techniques can be used as a basis\nfor this. To approach this question, this work investigates the effects of\ndifferent optimization passes on a representative selection of quantum\ncircuits. Since hardly any tools to automatically design and evaluate FTQC\nquantum circuits exist yet, we utilize resource estimation to compare the\n(potential) benefits gained by applying NISQ quantum circuit optimization to\nestimated FTQC resource requirements. The results indicate that, indeed, the\nestimated resource requirements for FTQC can be improved by applying NISQ\nquantum circuit optimization techniques.

Hence, quantum error correction becomes essential but induces\nsignificant overheads in qubits and execution time, often by orders of\nmagnitude. Obviously, these overheads must be reduced. Since many quantum\napplications can tolerate some noise, end users can provide a maximum tolerated\nerror, the error budget, to be considered during compilation and execution.\nThis error budget, or, more precisely, its distribution, can be a key factor in\nachieving the overhead reduction. Conceptually, an error-corrected quantum\ncircuit can be divided into different parts that each have a specific purpose.\nErrors can happen in any of these parts and their errors sum up to the\nmentioned error budget, but how to distribute it among them actually\nconstitutes a degree of freedom. This work is based on the idea that some of\nthe circuit parts can compensate for errors more efficiently than others.\nConsequently, these parts should contribute more to satisfy the total error\nbudget than the parts where it is more costly. However, this poses the\nchallenge of finding optimal distributions. We address this challenge not only\nby providing general guidelines on distributing the error budget, but also a\nmethod that automatically determines resource-efficient distributions for\narbitrary circuits by training a machine learning model on an accumulated\ndataset.

Our approach builds on\nrecent developments in non-semisimple topological quantum field theories in\n(2+1)-dimensions, which extend the traditional semisimple paradigm. While\nstandard Ising anyons are limited to Clifford operations and thus not\ncomputationally universal, we show that their non-semisimple counterparts give\nrise to new anyon types we call \\emph{neglectons}; adding a single neglecton to\nthe traditional Ising theory enables universal quantum computation through\nbraiding alone.\n  The resulting braid group representations are unitary with respect to an\nindefinite Hermitian form, with the computational subspace embedded in a\npositive-definite sector. We identify a range of parameters for which the model\nsupports universal gate sets and, notably, special values of the parameter\n$\\alpha$ where the computational subspace decouples exactly from the\nnegative-norm components of the Hilbert space. This leads to low-leakage, fully\nunitary evolution on the physical subspace and improved prospects for efficient\ngate compilation."}

This is particularly true for\ndebugging due to quantum bugs, i.e., bugs that occur precisely because an\nalgorithm is a quantum algorithm. Pinpointing a quantum bug's root cause often\nrequires significant developer time, as there is little established guidance\nfor quantum debugging techniques. Developing such guidance is the main\nchallenge we sought to address. In this work, we describe a set of 14 quantum\nbugs, sourced primarily from our experience as quantum software developers, and\nsupplemented by analysis of open-source GitHub repositories. We detail their\ncontext, symptoms, and the techniques applied to identify and fix them. While\nclassifying these bugs based on existing schemes, we observed that most emerged\ndue to unique interactions between multiple aspects of an algorithm or\nworkflow. In other words, they occurred because more than one thing went wrong,\nwhich provided important insight into why quantum debugging is more\nchallenging. Furthermore, based on this clustering, we found that -\nunexpectedly - there is no clear relationship between debugging strategies and\nbug classes. Further research is needed to develop effective and systematic\nquantum debugging strategies."}
