By carefully\nselecting measurement bases (typically polarization), their violation certifies\nquantum entanglement. Such measurements are disrupted by the presence of\noptical disorder in propagation paths, including polarization or spatial mode\nmixing in fibers and through free-space turbulence. Here, we demonstrate that\ndisorder can instead be exploited as a resource to certify entanglement via a\nBell inequality test. In our experiment, one photon of a polarization-entangled\npair propagates through a commercial multimode fiber that scrambles spatial and\npolarization modes, producing a speckle pattern, while the other photon remains\nwith the sender. By spatially resolving the speckle intensity pattern, we\nnaturally access a large set of random and unknown polarization projections. We\nshow that this set is statistically sufficient to violate a Bell inequality,\nthereby certifying entanglement without requiring active correction techniques.\nOur approach provides a fundamentally new way to test Bell inequalities,\neliminating the need for an explicit choice of measurement basis, and offering\na practical solution for entanglement certification in real-world quantum\ncommunication channels where disorder is unavoidable."}

In particular, no quantum\noperation can transform a finite number of copies of an unknown quantum state\nor channel into a pure state or channel that depends on the input, thereby\nruling out an important form of universal purification in both static and\ndynamical settings. Relaxing the requirement of exact pure output, we further\nextend our result to establish quantitative sample complexity bounds for\napproximate purification, independent of any task details or operational\nconstraints. To illustrate the practical consequences of this principle, we\nexamine the task of approximately preparing pure dilation and, for the first\ntime, prove an exponential lower bound on the required sample complexity."}

Amplification is known to boost any inverse-polynomial gap between\ncompleteness and soundness to exponentially small error, and a recent result\n(Jeffery and Witteveen, 2025) shows that completeness can in fact be amplified\nto be doubly exponentially close to 1. We prove that this is optimal for\nblack-box procedures: we provide a quantum oracle relative to which no QMA\nverification procedure using polynomial resources can achieve completeness\ncloser to 1 than doubly exponential, or a soundness which is\nsuper-exponentially small. This is proven by using techniques from complex\napproximation theory, to make the oracle separation from (Aaronson, 2008),\nbetween QMA and QMA with perfect completeness, quantitative."}

A\nkey feature of these NSLG states is oscillations of the electron wave packet's\nroot-mean-square (r.m.s.) radius, similar to betatron oscillations.\nClassically, such an oscillating charge distribution is expected to emit\nphotons. This raises a critical question: does this radiation carry away OAM,\nleading to a loss of the electron's vorticity? To investigate this, we solve\nMaxwell's equations using the charge and current densities derived from an\nelectron in the NSLG state. We calculate the total radiated power and the\nangular momentum of the emitted field, quantifying the rate at which a vortex\nelectron loses its energy and OAM while propagating in a longitudinal magnetic\nfield. We find both the radiated power and the angular momentum losses to be\nnegligible indicating that linear accelerators (linacs) appear to be a\nprominent tool for maintaining vorticity of relativistic vortex electrons and\nother charged particles, at least in the quasi-classical approximation."}

This motivates the study of quantum divergences that\npreserve their operational meaning while faithfully capturing these\ncomputational constraints. Using geometric, computational, and information\ntheoretic tools, we define two new types of computational divergences, which we\nterm computational max-divergence and computational measured R\\'enyi\ndivergences. Both are constrained by a family of efficient binary measurements,\nand thus useful for state discrimination tasks in the computational setting. We\nprove that, in the infinite-order limit, the computational measured R\\'enyi\ndivergence coincides with the computational max-divergence, mirroring the\ncorresponding relation in the unconstrained information-theoretic setting. For\nthe many-copy regime, we introduce regularized versions and establish a\none-sided computational Stein bound on achievable hypothesis-testing exponents\nunder efficient measurements, giving the regularized computational measured\nrelative entropy an operational meaning. We further define resource measures\ninduced by our computational divergences and prove an asymptotic continuity\nbound for the computational measured relative entropy of resource. Focusing on\nentanglement, we relate our results to previously proposed computational\nentanglement measures and provide explicit separations from the\ninformation-theoretic setting. Together, these results provide a principled,\ncohesive approach towards state discrimination tasks and resource\nquantification under computational constraints."}
