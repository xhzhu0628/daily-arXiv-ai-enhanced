Chapter 3 presents foundational algorithms such as entanglement\ncreation, quantum teleportation, Deutsch-Jozsa, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Simon's\nalgorithm.\n  Chapters 4 and 5 cover algorithms based on the quantum Fourier transform,\nincluding phase estimation, period finding, factoring, and logarithm\ncomputation. These chapters also include complexity analysis and detailed\nquantum circuits suitable for implementation in code. Chapter 6 introduces\nGrover's algorithm for quantum search and amplitude amplification, including\nits realization via Hamiltonian simulation and a method for derandomization.\n  Chapter 7 discusses basic techniques for Hamiltonian simulation, such as\nLie-Trotter decomposition, sparse Hamiltonians, and the linear combination of\nunitaries. It also provides example circuits for simulating Hamiltonians\nexpressed as linear combinations of Pauli operators.

While\nthis approach itself is still in its infancy, and many obstacles must still be\novercome before its physical implementation, challenges from the software and\nalgorithmic side must also be identified and addressed. For instance, this\nparadigm shift requires a new form of compiler that considers the network\nconstraints in general as well as phenomena arising due to the nature of\nquantum communication. In distributed quantum computing, large circuits are\ndivided into smaller subcircuits such that they can be executed individually\nand simultaneously on multiple QPUs that are connected through quantum\nchannels. As quantum communication, for example, in the form of teleportation,\nis expensive, it must be used sparingly. We address the problem of assigning\nqubits to QPUs to minimize communication costs in two different ways.

These measures play a crucial role\nin classical mechanics, as they effectively define its geometric structure.

[Mathematical Programming, 1 - 49 (2021)], which\nprovides converging outer bounds on the optimal fidelity of approximate quantum\nerror correction (AQEC). As our first contribution, we introduce a\nmeasurement-based rounding scheme that extracts inner sequences of certifiably\ngood encoder-decoder pairs from this outer hierarchy. To address the\ncomputational complexity of evaluating fixed levels of the hierarchy, we\ninvestigate the use of symmetry-based dimension reduction. In particular, we\ncombine noise symmetries - such as those present in multiple copies of the\nqubit depolarizing channel - with the permutational symmetry arising from the\nextendability of the optimization variable. This framework is illustrated\nthrough basic, but already challenging numerical examples that showcase its\npractical effectiveness. Our results contribute to narrowing the gap between\ntheoretical developments in quantum information theory and their practical\napplications in the analysis of small-scale quantum error-correcting codes."}

While quantum completeness and classical\nsoundness of the construction have been established for all multipartite games,\nquantum soundness is known only in the special case of bipartite games.\n  In this paper, we prove that the Kalai et al.'s compiler indeed achieves\nquantum soundness for all multipartite compiled non-local games, by showing\nthat any correlations that can be generated in the asymptotic case correspond\nto quantum commuting strategies.\n  Our proof uses techniques from the theory of operator algebras, and relies on\na characterisation of sequential operationally no-signalling strategies as\nquantum commuting operator strategies in the multipartite case, thereby\ngeneralising several previous results.
