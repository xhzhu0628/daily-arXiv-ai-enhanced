Here, we\npropose and experimentally demonstrate a purely geometric two-qubit swap gate\nby transiently populating qubit doublon states of fermionic atoms in a\ndynamical optical lattice.

This yields a gate\nmechanism that is intrinsically protected against fluctuations and\ninhomogeneities of the confining potentials. The resilience of the gate is\nfurther reinforced by time-reversal and chiral symmetries of the Hamiltonian.\nWe experimentally validate this exceptional protection, achieving a\nloss-corrected amplitude fidelity of $99.91(7)\\%$ measured across the entire\nsystem consisting of more than $17'000$ atom pairs.

In this work we will demonstrate a method\nutilizing closed loop control of the collective magnetic moment of an ensemble\nof cold neutral atoms via non-destructive measurements to emulate various spin\nsystem Hamiltonians. By modifying the feedback control law appropriately we are\nable to generate nonlinear dynamical behavior in the ensemble, allowing us to\nexplore the physics of collective spin systems at mesoscopic scales. Moreover,\ncontrolling the number of atoms in the collective spin can potentially allow us\nto investigate these dynamics in the transition from fully quantum to the\nclassical limit.

Based on this idea Bell constructed an inequality whereby\nexperimental tests could distinguish between quantum mechanics and\nlocal-realistic theories. Many experiments have since been done that are\nconsistent with quantum mechanics, disproving the concept of local realism. But\nall these tests suffered from loopholes allowing a local-realistic explanation\nof the experimental observations. In this context, of special interest is\nentanglement between different quantum objects like atoms and photons, because\nit allows one to entangle distant atoms by the interference of photons. The\nresulting space-like separation together with the almost perfect detection\nefficiency of the atoms will allow a first event-ready Bell test closing\ndetection and locality loopholes.\n  The primary goal of the present thesis was the experimental realization of\nentanglement between a single localized atom and a single spontaneously emitted\nphoton. In the experiment a single optically trapped R87 atom is excited to a\nstate which has two selected decay channels. In the following spontaneous decay\na photon is emitted coherently with equal probability into both decay channels.\nThis accounts for perfect correlations between the polarization state of the\nemitted photon and the Zeeman state of the atom after spontaneous decay.\nBecause these decay channels are spectrally and in all other degrees of freedom\nindistinguishable, the spin state of the atom is entangled with the\npolarization state of the photon. To verify entanglement, appropriate\ncorrelation measurements in complementary bases of the photon polarization and\nthe internal quantum state of the atom were performed. It is shown, that the\ngenerated atom-photon state yields an entanglement fidelity of 0.82."}

The circuit is a product state where each qubit represents a spin.\nThe spin wave motion is represented by opening the cone angle using Y rotations\nand then adding progressive Z rotations along the chain to represent wave\npropagation. We show analytically that this product state yields the correct\ndispersion relation in the limit of an unbounded chain.

Here, using a superconducting-qubit-based transmon device, we show that\npre-fault-tolerant digital quantum simulation is reliable for studying\ntransport phenomena via spin-current autocorrelation function (ACF). While\nquantum simulations of the spin-spin ACF have been used to probe spin\ntransport, methods based on the spin-current ACF have yet to be demonstrated\ndue to their high gate cost, despite offering more direct information relevant\nto the transport properties. Overcoming the resource constraints set by\nindirect measurement schemes like the Hadamard test, we showcase a direct\nmeasurement scheme that utilizes non-unitary operations, in particular\nmid-circuit measurements, to investigate spin transport for the 40-site 1D XXZ\nHeisenberg model in the near-ballistic, superdiffusive, and diffusive regimes.\nWe successfully reproduce the expected power-law behavior in the superdiffusive\nregime and vanishing of the Drude weight in the diffusive regime."}

On a zero background, solitons move classically, following Newton`s\nsecond law, however, on a non-zero amplitude chaotic background, their momentum\nand position fluctuate fulfilling an exact uncertainty relation, which give\nrise to the emergence of quantum phenomena. The Schrodinger equation for the\nensemble of solitons is obtained from this exact uncertainty relation, and the\namplitude of the background fluctuations is what corresponds to the value of\n$\\hbar$. We confirm our analytical results running simulations of solitons\nmoving against a potential barrier and comparing the ensemble probabilities\nwith the predictions of the time dependent Schr\\\"odinger equation, providing a\ndeterministic version of the quantum tunneling effect.

We investigate this problem by leveraging an observable-dependent\napproach to equilibration and thermalization in isolated quantum systems. We\nextend such approach to scenarios with non-commuting charges, and show that it\ncan accurately estimate the equilibrium distribution of coarse observables\nwithout access to the energy eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Our predictions do\nnot require weak coupling and are not restricted to local observables, thus\nproviding an advantage over the non-Abelian thermal state. Within this\napproach, weak values and quasiprobability distributions emerge naturally and\nplay a crucial role in characterizing the equilibrium distributions of\nobservables.

Recent advances have significantly deepened our understanding\nof magic as a resource across diverse domains, including many-body physics,\nnuclear and particle physics, and quantum chemistry. Central to this progress\nis the stabilizer R\\'enyi entropy, a computable and experimentally accessible\nmagic monotone. Despite its widespread adoption, a rigorous operational\ninterpretation of the stabilizer entropy has remained an open problem. In this\nwork, we provide such an interpretation in the context of quantum property\ntesting. By showing that the stabilizer entropy is the most robust measurable\nmagic monotone, we demonstrate that the Clifford orbit of a quantum state\nbecomes exponentially indistinguishable from Haar-random states, at a rate\ngoverned by the stabilizer entropy $M(\\psi)$ and the number of available\ncopies. This implies that the Clifford orbit forms an approximate state\n$k$-design, with an approximation error $\\Theta(\\exp(-M(\\psi))$. Conversely, we\nestablish that the optimal probability of distinguishing a given quantum state\nfrom the set of stabilizer states is also governed by its stabilizer entropy.\nThese results reveal that the stabilizer entropy quantitatively characterizes\nthe transition from stabilizer states to universal quantum states, thereby\noffering a comprehensive operational perspective of the stabilizer entropy as a\nquantum resource."}
