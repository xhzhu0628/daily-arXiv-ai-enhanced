### [1] [Relativistic electrodynamics with a universal length scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08872)
*Tiemo Pedergnana,Florian Kogelbauer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 从具有普适长度尺度的四阶Klein-Gordon方程推导出Dirac和Pauli方程的类似形式，并通过代数分解得到32维Dirac方程。实验验证通过Stern-Gerlach实验中的电子束分裂线进行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索高阶Klein-Gordon方程与Dirac和Pauli方程的关系，并验证其物理意义。

Method: 从Maxwell方程的奇异扰动变体出发，通过代数分解推导32维Dirac方程。

Result: 理论预测了电子束在Stern-Gerlach实验中的超精细分裂，得到四个自旋算符特征值。

Conclusion: 修正的电动力学框架展示了粒子-反粒子不对称性和微观极化时空。

Abstract: We derive the analogues of the Dirac and Pauli equations from a spatially
fourth-order Klein--Gordon equation with a universal length scale. Starting
from a singularly perturbed variant of Maxwell's equations, we deduce a
32-dimensional variant of the Dirac equation for spin-$1/2$ particles through
an algebraic factorization procedure. We illustrate an experimental test of the
theory from the split lines of the electron beam in a Stern--Gerlach
experiment. This hyperfine splitting leads to four distinct eigenvalues of the
spin operator, which can be grouped into two pairs centered around the classic
values of $\pm\hbar/2$. The modified electrodynamic framework features
particle-antiparticle asymmetry and an oriented, micropolar spacetime.

### [2] [Variational subspace methods and application to improving variational Monte Carlo dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08930)
*Adrien Kahn,Luca Gravina,Filippo Vicentini*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种直接操作和优化子空间的形式化方法，避免了在子空间方法中优化单个状态的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要优化单个状态，而子空间方法可以更高效地处理多个状态，因此需要一种直接操作子空间的形式化方法。

Method: 使用行列式状态映射，将距离、能量和蒙特卡洛估计器等概念自然扩展到子空间。

Result: 提出了Bridge方法，通过提取变分时间演化状态的线性组合，显著降低了动力学离散化带来的误差。

Conclusion: Bridge方法计算成本低，可作为变分动力学的后处理工具，有效提升性能。

Abstract: We present a formalism that allows for the direct manipulation and
optimization of subspaces, circumventing the need to optimize individual states
when using subspace methods. Using the determinant state mapping, we can
naturally extend notions such as distance and energy to subspaces, as well as
Monte Carlo estimators, recovering the excited states estimation method
proposed by Pfau et al. As a practical application, we then introduce Bridge, a
method that improves the performance of variational dynamics by extracting
linear combinations of variational time-evolved states. We find that Bridge is
both computationally inexpensive and capable of significantly mitigating the
errors that arise from discretizing the dynamics, and can thus be
systematically used as a post-processing tool for variational dynamics.

### [3] [Long-ranged gates in quantum computation architectures with limited connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08936)
*Wolfgang Dür*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于最近邻相互作用的量子计算架构，支持并行长距离两量子比特门操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何在几何结构中高效实现量子计算，尤其是利用多体纠缠态和中间电路测量。

Result: 在平面架构中，实现了O(√n)个长距离两量子比特门的并行操作，适用于现有超导量子计算架构。

Conclusion: 该架构在现有技术条件下高效实现了并行量子门操作，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: We propose a quantum computation architecture based on geometries with
nearest-neighbor interactions, including e.g. planar structures. We show how to
efficiently split the role of qubits into data and entanglement-generation
qubits. Multipartite entangled states, e.g. 2D cluster states, are generated
among the latter, and flexibly transformed via mid-circuit measurements to
multiple, long-ranged Bell states, which are used to perform several two-qubit
gates in parallel on data qubits. We introduce planar architectures with $n$
data and $n$ auxiliary qubits that allow one to perform $O(\sqrt n)$
long-ranged two-qubit gates simultaneously, with only one round of nearest
neighbor gates and one round of mid-circuit measurements. We also show that our
approach is applicable in existing superconducting quantum computation
architectures, with only a constant overhead.

### [4] [Robust Chiral Edge Dynamics of a Kitaev Honeycomb on a Trapped Ion Processor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08939)

Result: 观察到非阿贝尔相中的手性边缘动力学，表明拓扑序存在；Heisenberg相互作用强弱影响拓扑保护。

Conclusion: 研究为量子模拟强关联材料中的拓扑序提供了可行方法，拓展了量子计算的应用。

Abstract: Kitaev's honeycomb model is a paradigmatic exactly solvable system hosting a
quantum spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and topologically protected edge
modes, offering a platform for fault-tolerant quantum computation. However,
real candidate Kitaev materials invariably include complex secondary
interactions that obscure the realization of spin-liquid behavior and demand
novel quantum computational approaches for efficient simulation. Here we report
quantum simulations of a 22-site Kitaev honeycomb lattice on a trapped-ion
quantum processor, without and with non-integrable Heisenberg interactions that
are present in real materials. We develop efficient quantum circuits for
ground-state preparation, then apply controlled perturbations and measure
time-dependent spin correlations along the system's edge. In the non-Abelian
phase, we observe chiral edge dynamics consistent with a nonzero Chern number
-- a hallmark of topological order -- which vanishes upon transition to the
Abelian toric code phase. Extending to the non-integrable Kitaev-Heisenberg
model, we find that weak Heisenberg interactions preserve chiral edge dynamics,
while stronger couplings suppress them, signaling the breakdown of topological
protection. Our work demonstrates a viable route for probing dynamical
signatures of topological order in quantum spin liquids using programmable
quantum hardware, opening new pathways for quantum simulation of strongly
correlated materials.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 首次实现基于面心立方（FCC）晶格的蛋白质结构预测量子算法，展示了FCC晶格在建模蛋白质二级结构上的优势，并比较了两种量子方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FCC晶格比其他晶格更能准确建模蛋白质的二级结构，通过RMSD验证其优越性。

Method: 采用多项式拟合（PolyFit）和基于拉格朗日对偶原理的变分量子特征求解器（VQEC）两种量子方法。

Result: 在Eagle R3和Heron R2量子计算机上成功恢复了6氨基酸序列KLVFFA的基态构型，Heron R2架构性能显著提升。

Conclusion: 量子硬件进步对蛋白质结构预测应用有显著影响，Heron R2架构表现更优。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first implementation of the face-centered cubic
(FCC) lattice model for protein structure prediction with a quantum algorithm.
Our motivation to encode the FCC lattice stems from our observation that the
FCC lattice is more capable in terms of modeling realistic secondary structures
in proteins compared to other lattices, as demonstrated using root mean square
deviation (RMSD). We utilize two quantum methods to solve this problem: a
polynomial fitting approach (PolyFit) and the Variational Quantum Eigensolver
with constraints (VQEC) based on the Lagrangian duality principle. Both methods
are successfully deployed on Eagle R3 (ibm_cleveland) and Heron R2
(ibm_kingston) quantum computers, where we are able to recover ground state
configurations for the 6-amino acid sequence KLVFFA under noise. A comparative
analysis of the outcomes generated by the two QPUs reveals a significant
enhancement (reaching nearly a two-fold improvement for PolyFit and a
three-fold improvement for VQEC) in the prediction and sampling of the optimal
solution (ground state conformations) on the newer Heron R2 architecture,
highlighting the impact of quantum hardware advancements for this application.

### [6] [Approximate quantum circuit compilation for proton-transfer kinetics on quantum processors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08996)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于核电子轨道框架的量子计算算法，用于模拟质子转移反应，并通过自适应近似量子编译技术在高噪声的当前量子设备上实现了高精度的模拟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 质子转移反应在化学和生物系统中至关重要，但经典方法难以准确捕捉量子效应（如隧穿、离域和零点运动），且计算复杂度随系统规模急剧增加。

Method: 采用核电子轨道框架，将质子量子力学处理，并通过冻结自然轨道近似构建深度初始ansätze，再通过自适应近似量子编译技术平衡电路深度与状态保真度。

Result: 在IBM_FEZ设备上模拟质子转移路径的势垒高度和离域质子密度，结果显示尽管当前硬件噪声较大，但方法仍能将能量势垒估计误差控制在参考值的13%以内。

Conclusion: 尽管当前量子硬件存在限制，该方法为近期设备和早期容错量子计算系统提供了一种实用的近似关键电路段的手段。

Abstract: Proton transfer reactions are fundamental to many chemical and biological
systems, where quantum effects such as tunneling, delocalization, and
zero-point motion play key kinetic control roles. However, classical methods
capable of accurately capturing these phenomena scale prohibitively with system
size. Here, we develop and demonstrate quantum computing algorithms based on
the Nuclear-Electronic Orbital framework, treating the transferring proton
quantum mechanically. We assess the potential of current quantum devices for
simulating proton transfer kinetics with high accuracy. We first construct a
deep initial ans\"atze within a truncated orbital space by employing the frozen
natural orbital approximation. Then, to balance circuit depth against state
fidelity, we implement an adaptive form of approximate quantum compiling. Using
resulting circuits at varying compression levels transpiled for the ibm_fez
device, we compute barrier heights and delocalised proton densities along the
proton transfer pathway using a realistic hardware noise model. We find that,
although current quantum hardware introduces significant noise relative to the
demanding energy tolerances involved, our approach allows substantial circuit
simplification while maintaining energy barrier estimates within 13% of the
reference value. Despite present hardware limitations, these results offer a
practical means of approximating key circuit segments in near-term devices and
early fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

### [7] [Photon-Number-Resolving Detector Based on a Cascade of Waveguide-Coupled Quantum Emitters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09034)
*Abdolreza Pasharavesh,Sai Sreesh Venuturumilli,Michal Bajcsy*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了基于波导耦合发射器的光子数分辨探测器，分析了其线性和非线性性能，并优于传统方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索一种新型光子数分辨探测器，以克服传统方案在性能上的限制。

Method: 使用格林函数和输入输出形式推导散射矩阵和光子关联，结合量子轨迹方法分析非线性性能。

Result: 提出的探测器在现实条件下优于传统方案。

Conclusion: 该方案是下一代光子数分辨探测器的有潜力候选者。

Abstract: We investigate the operation of a photon-number-resolving (PNR) detector
consisting of a cascade of waveguide-coupled lambda-type emitters, where each
waveguide-coupled emitter extracts a single photon from the input light and
sends it to a single-photon detector. Using Green's function and input-output
formalisms, we derive the scattering matrices and photon-photon correlators for
individual scatterers. By cascading these results, we obtain a closed-form
expression for the detector's precision in the linear regime and predict how
correlations generated by nonlinear photon-photon interactions influence this
precision. To evaluate the performance of this PNR detector in the nonlinear
regime, we apply the quantum trajectory method to the cascaded setup,
calculating the achievable precision and analyzing its dependence on key system
parameters, such as the number of emitters and their coupling strength to the
waveguide. We compare the performance of the proposed PNR detector with that of
a conventional PNR scheme based on spatial demultiplexing via beamsplitters.
Our results indicate that the proposed scheme can outperform conventional
detectors under realistic conditions, making it a promising candidate for
next-generation PNR detection.

### [8] [Microcausality and Tunneling Times in Relativistic Quantum Field Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09066)
*Mohammed Alkhateeb,Alex Matzkin*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文证明在量子场论框架下，微观因果性排除了超光速隧穿动力学。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在背景势场下Dirac和Klein-Gordon场的微观因果性，并探讨其对隧穿动力学的影响。

Method: 首先证明微观因果性在背景势场下成立，然后通过数值计算验证Dirac费米子和Klein-Gordon玻色子的结果。

Result: 干预初始波包的局部区域不会在光锥外产生任何效应。

Conclusion: 微观因果性确保了隧穿动力学不会违反相对论的光速限制。

Abstract: We show, in the framework of a space-time resolved relativistic quantum eld
theory approach to tunneling, that microcausality precludes superluminal
tunneling dynamics. More specically in this work dealing with Dirac and
Klein-Gordon elds, we rst prove that microcausality holds for such elds in the
presence of a background potential. We then use this result to show that an
intervention performed on a localized region of an initial wave packet
subsequently scattering on a potential barrier does not result in any eect
outside the light cone emanating from that region. We illustrate these results
with numerical computations for Dirac fermions and Klein-Gordon bosons.

### [9] [Time crystals and nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions mediated by squeezed bath](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09072)

Conclusion: 研究强调了在工程环境中研究时间晶体的重要性，为合作性模型提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Nonequilibrium dissipative phase transition, arising from the competition of
cooperative behavior and coherent field driving, discovered in the 1970s by
Narducci et al. and Walls et al., has been found to exhibit time-crystal
behavior when the driving field exceeds the cooperative decay rate. This was
seen through the study of the eigenvalues of the Liouvillian superoperator that
describes the joint effect of drive and cooperativity. The cooperative decay
depends on the nature of the reservoir correlations. If the reservoir
correlations have phase-sensitive behavior, then the eigenvalues of the
Liouvillian will be different. We investigate the time-crystal behavior of the
nonequilibrium dissipative phase transitions under the influence of a squeezed
vacuum reservoir. We analyze the steady-state phase diagram as a function of
the control parameter and demonstrate that increasing the squeezing strength
sharpens the dissipative phase transition. Spectral analysis of the Liouvillian
reveals gap closings and the emergence of purely imaginary eigenvalues in the
thermodynamic limit, indicating the time-crystal phase. We find that the real
parts of subleading eigenvalues exhibit nonmonotonic behavior with increasing
squeezing, reflecting the sensitivity of relaxation dynamics to the reservoir
properties. Time-domain simulations confirm that the oscillation frequencies
correspond to the imaginary parts of the Liouvillian eigenvalues. We also
present results on quantum fluctuations in the time-crystal phase. Our results
call attention to the study of time crystals in models of cooperativity based
on engineered environments.

### [10] [The temporal resolution limit in quantum sensing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09172)
*Cong-Gang Song,Qing-yu Cai*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该研究结合量子态的可区分条件和量子速度限制，建立了探测时间的最小下限，并探讨了其对磁场测量和时间分辨率的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子传感中的时间分辨率是一个关键指标，研究旨在确定探测时间的最小下限，以避免信息丢失。

Method: 结合量子态的可区分条件和量子速度限制，推导出探测时间的下限，并扩展到时间依赖的信号哈密顿量。

Result: 理论表明，利用量子控制技术可以计算任意信号哈密顿量的最小探测时间。

Conclusion: 研究为量子传感中的时间分辨率提供了理论支持，并展示了量子速度限制的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Temporal resolution is a critical figure of merit in quantum sensing. This
study combines the distinguishable condition of quantum states with quantum
speed limits to establish a lower bound on interrogation time. When the
interrogation time falls below this bound, the output state becomes
statistically indistinguishable from the input state, and the information will
inevitably be lost in noise. Without loss of generality, we extend these
conclusions to time-dependent signal Hamiltonian. In theory, leveraging certain
quantum control techniques allows us to calculate the minimum interrogation
time for arbitrary signal Hamiltonian. Finally, we illustrate the impact of
quantum speed limits on magnetic field measurements and temporal resolution.

Abstract: Quantum metrology experiments in atomic physics and quantum optics have
demonstrated measurement accuracy beyond the shot-noise limit via
multi-particle entanglement. At the same time, electron microscopy, an
essential tool for high-resolution imaging of biological systems, is severely
constrained in its signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) by shot noise, due to the dose
limit imposed by electron beam-induced damage. Here, we show theoretically that
spin squeezing, a form of quantum metrology based on entanglement, is a natural
fit for improving the SNR in electron microscopy. We investigate the generation
of the necessary entangled states through electron-electron Coulomb
interactions and quantum non-demolition measurements. Our results connect the
fields of quantum metrology and electron interferometry, paving the way toward
electron microscopy with SNR beyond the shot-noise limit.

### [12] [Order-preserving condition for coherence measures of projective measurements with One Example](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09261)
*Hai Wang*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的条件——保序条件，用于量化投影测量或正交子空间的相干性，并验证了广义相干性度量满足该条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子叠加是量子力学的基本特征，如何量化叠加是一个关键问题。相干性框架已被广泛研究，但针对投影测量或正交子空间的相干性度量仍需进一步探索。

Method: 提出保序条件，并将其应用于广义相干性度量（1/2-亲和力的推广），验证其合理性。

Result: 广义相干性度量满足保序条件及其他合理条件，适用于投影测量和正交子空间。

Conclusion: 保序条件为相干性度量提供了新的数学基础，未来可推广至POVM情况。

Abstract: Superposition is an essential feature of quantum mechanics. From the
Schrodinger's cat to quantum algorithms such as Deutsch-Jorsza algorithm,
quantum superposition plays an important role. It is one fundamental and
crucial question how to quantify superposition. Until now, the framework of
coherence has been well established as one typical instance of quantum resource
theories. And the concept of coherence has been generalized into linearly
independent basis, projective measurements and POVMs. In this work, we will
focus on coherence measures for projective measurements or orthogonal
subspaces. One new condition, order-preserving condition, is proposed for such
measures. This condition is rooted in the mathematical structure of Hilbert
spaces' orthogonal decomposition. And by generalizing the 1/2-affinity of
coherence into subspace cases, we verify that this generalized coherence
measure satisfies the order-preserving condition. And it also satisfies other
reasonable conditions to be a good coherence measure. As the partial order
relationship exists for not only projective measurements, but also POVMs, it's
natural to study the order-preserving condition in POVM cases, which will be
the last part of this work.

### [13] [Defects and their Time Scales in Quantum and Classical Annealing of the Two-Dimensional Ising Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09273)
*Phillip Weinberg,Na Xu,Anders W. Sandvik*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了二维横向场伊辛铁磁体在量子退火过程中的缺陷行为，发现Kibble-Zurek（KZ）时间尺度与系统尺寸的关系，并观察到不同缺陷的动态尺度差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子退火过程中缺陷的形成和演化，以及其与经典模拟退火的类比和差异。

Method: 通过精确数值解分析L≤6的周期性晶格，研究缺陷的KZ时间尺度和动态行为。

Result: 发现KZ时间尺度与系统尺寸的关系，以及不同缺陷的动态尺度差异（如L³和L³.⁴）。

Conclusion: 量子退火和经典模拟退火中缺陷的动态行为存在差异，KZ时间尺度在两种过程中均起关键作用。

Abstract: We investigate defects in the two-dimensional transverse-field Ising
ferromagnet on periodic $L\times L$ lattices after quantum annealing from high
to vanishing field. With exact numerical solutions for $L \le 6$, we observe
the expected critical Kibble-Zurek (KZ) time scale $\propto L^{z+1/\nu}$ (with
$z=1$ and $1/\nu \approx 1.59$) at the quantum phase transition. We also
observe KZ scaling of the ground-state fidelity at the end of the process. The
excitations evolve by coarsening dynamics of confined defects, with a time
scale $\propto L^2$, and interface fluctuations of system-spanning defects,
with life time $\propto L^3$. We build on analogies with classical simulated
annealing, where we characterize system-spanning defects in detail and find
differences in the dynamic scales of domain walls with winding numbers
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ (horizontal/vertical) and $W=(1,1)$ (diagonal). They decay on
time scales $\propto L^3$ (which applies also to system-spanning domains in
systems with open boundaries) and $\propto L^{3.4}$, respectively, when imposed
in the ordered phase. As a consequence of $L^{3.4}$ exceeding the classical KZ
scale $L^{z+1/\nu}=L^{3.17}$ the probability of $W=(1,1)$ domains in SA scales
with the KZ exponent even in the final $T=0$ state. In QA, also the
$W=(1,0)/(0,1)$ domains are controlled by the KZ time scale $L^{2.59}$. The
$L^3$ scale can nevertheless be detected in the excited states, using a method
that we develop that should also be applicable in QA experiments.

Conclusion: 该工作为宽带JPA的简化实现提供了路径，并扩展了JPA操作新机制的理论基础。

Abstract: We present the experimental demonstration of an impedance-engineered
Josephson parametric amplifier (IEJPA) fabricated in a single-step lithography
process. Impedance engineering is implemented using a lumped-element series LC
circuit. We use a simpler lithography process where the entire device --
impedance transformer and JPA -- are patterned in a single electron beam
lithography step, followed by a double-angle Dolan bridge technique for
Al-AlO$_x$-Al deposition. We observe nearly quantum-limited amplification with
18 dB gain over a wide 400 MHz bandwidth centered around 5.3 GHz, and a
saturation power of -114 dBm. To accurately explain our experimental results,
we extend existing theories for impedance-engineered JPAs to incorporate the
full sine nonlinearity of both the JPA and the transformer. Our work shows a
path to simpler realization of broadband JPAs and provides a theoretical
foundation for a novel regime of JPA operation.

Conclusion: 超导体是实现超强耦合研究的有效工具，适用于小型磁通量子比特和低持续电流的高相干性电路。

Abstract: We present an ultrastrong superinductor-based coupling consisting of a flux
qubit galvanically coupled to a resonator. The coupling inductor is fabricated
in granular Aluminum, a superinductor material able to provide large surface
inductances. Spectroscopy measurements on the qubit-resonator system reveal a
Bloch-Siegert shift of \SI{23}{\mega\hertz} and a coupling fraction of
$g/\omega_r \simeq 0.13$, entering the perturbative ultrastrong coupling (USC)
regime. We estimate the inductance of the coupler independently by
low-temperature resistance measurements providing $L_c =
(0.74\pm0.14)\,\mathrm{nH}$, which is compatible with $g/\omega \gtrsim 0.1$.
Our results show that superinductors are a promising tool to study USC physics
in high-coherence circuits using flux qubits with small loop areas and low
persistent currents.

Result: 成功将素数幂量子比特稳定子态分解为p级GHZ态、EPR对和无纠缠量子比特。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于需要高效纠缠分布的量子协议。

Abstract: We study the entanglement structure of tripartite stabilizer states on $N$
qudits of dimension $D$, distributed across parties $A$, $B$, and $C$, under
arbitrary local unitaries. Prior work by Bravyi et al. and Looi et al. showed
that qubit and squarefree qudit stabilizer states can be transformed via local
Clifford unitaries into tensor products of GHZ states, EPR pairs, and
unentangled qudits [arXiv:quant-ph/0504208, arXiv:1107.1761]. We generalize
this to arbitrary integer $D$ by introducing local unitaries beyond the
Clifford group, enabling decomposition of prime-power qudit stabilizer states
into $p$-level GHZ states, EPR pairs, and unentangled qudits. Our algorithm
leverages subsystem phase matrices to characterize entanglement and applies to

Abstract: Quantum computers may one day enable the efficient simulation of
strongly-coupled plasmas that lie beyond the reach of classical computation in
regimes where quantum effects are important and the scale separation is large.
In this letter, we take the first step towards efficient simulation of quantum
plasmas by demonstrating linear plasma wave propagation on a superconducting
quantum chip. Using high-fidelity and highly expressive device-native gates,
combined with a novel error mitigation technique, we simulate the scattering of
laser pulses from inhomogeneous plasmas. Our approach is made feasible by the
identification of a suitable local spin model whose excitations mimic plasma
waves, whose circuit implementation requires a lower gate count than other
proposed approaches that would require a future fault-tolerant quantum
computer. This work opens avenues to study more complicated phenomena that
cannot be simulated efficiently on classical computers, such as nonlinear
quantum dynamics when strongly-coupled plasmas are driven out of equilibrium.

Abstract: Entanglement is a cornerstone of quantum technology, playing a key role in
quantum computing, cryptography, and information processing. Conventional
methods for generating entanglement via optical setups rely on beam splitters,
nonlinear media, or quantum dots, which often require bulky configurations and
precise phase control. In contrast, metasurfaces - ultrathin, engineered
optical interfaces - offer a compact and tunable alternative for quantum
photonics. In this work, we demonstrate that metasurfaces can serve as a
promising platform for generating Bell states through a Hamiltonian-driven
spin-entanglement mechanism. By analyzing the system's evolution under a
metasurface interaction Hamiltonian, we show that an initially separable spin
state evolves into a maximally entangled Bell state. We further study classical
and quantum correlations, evaluate the impact of environmental decoherence, and
compute quantum discord to quantify correlation robustness beyond entanglement.
Our analysis shows that metasurfaces can generate Bell states with a
concurrence of about 0.995 and maintain quantum discord for up to 29
microseconds. These results establish metasurfaces as scalable, high-fidelity
components for next-generation quantum photonic architectures.

Abstract: We study classical and quantum echoes in a Kerr oscillator driven by a
frequency-controlling pulsed perturbation. We consider dynamical response to
the perturbation for a single coherent state and for Schr\"odinger cat states
constructed as both balanced and imbalanced superpositions of two coherent
states. For individual coherent states, we demonstrate that a weak parametric
drive yields a long-lived sequence of classical echoes. Cat states are found to
exhibit distinct quantum echoes that are sensitive to the initial relative
phase and weights of the coherent states in superposition. We examine the
effect of dissipation on quantum echoes and quantum revivals of cat states. We
demonstrate that, even when dissipation suppresses quantum revivals, quantum
echoes can be recovered by properly tuning the timing and strength of the
perturbation. These results may be useful for characterizing and mitigating
errors of cat qubits.

Abstract: A set of new schemes for quantum computation and communication have been
either designed or experimentally realized using optimal quantum resources. A
multi-output quantum teleportation scheme, where a sender (Alice) teleports an
m and m+1-qubit GHZ-like unknown state to a receiver (Bob), has been
demonstrated using two copies of the Bell state instead of a five-qubit cluster
state and implemented on IBM's quantum computer for the m=1 case. Another
scheme, known as quantum broadcasting where a known state is sent to two
spatially separated parties (Bob and Charlie) has also been realized using two
Bell states. It is shown that existing quantum broadcasting schemes can be
reduced to multiparty remote state preparation. After achieving teleportation
of unknown and known states, sending a quantum operator becomes the next step.
A scheme for remote implementation of operators (RIO), specifically a
controlled joint-RIO (CJRIO), has been proposed using a four-qubit
hyper-entangled state involving spatial and polarization degrees of freedom. In
this direction, two more variants, remote implementation of hidden and
partially unknown operators (RIHO and RIPUO) have also been proposed. Their
success probabilities are analyzed considering dissipation of an auxiliary
coherent state interacting with the environment. For secure multiparty tasks
like quantum voting or auction, secure multiparty quantum computation (SMQC)
becomes essential. A quantum anonymous voting (QAV) scheme has been
experimentally implemented on IBM's quantum computer. Finally, two quantum key
distribution (QKD) protocols, coherent one-way (COW) and differential phase
shift (DPS), are experimentally demonstrated and the key rates are analyzed as
functions of post-processing parameters and detector dead times across various
distances.

Conclusion: Ensemble-IR为量子系统开发提供了高效、简洁的解决方案。

Abstract: Emerging quantum applications such as error mitigation, system
characterization, and hybrid protocols often require running large families of
related quantum circuits. Existing intermediate representations (IRs) and
frameworks such as Qiskit, QIR, MitiQ, and OpenQASM do not provide primitives
to concisely express such workloads. These tools instead rely on explicit
enumeration of the unique circuits within each workload. We introduce
Ensemble-IR, an intermediate representation designed to concisely express these
ensemble workloads. Rather than enumerating each circuit separately,
Ensemble-IR encodes an entire workload through a rich, shared unified program.
This program specifies common circuit structure along with symbolic operations
to express points of variation - such as gate types, gate placement, parameter
values, or qubit configurations. Ensemble-IR enables quantum systems to load an
entire family of circuits onto a device as a single concise file, allowing
contained circuits to instead be recreated on-the-fly at runtime. We
demonstrate Ensemble-IR across 18 real-world workloads from prior literature,
highlighting its widespread utility for scalable quantum system development.

Abstract: We propose an experimental scheme for enhancing entanglement, achieving
asymmetric Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering, and creating nonreciprocal
quantum correlations within a hybrid system. This system integrates a yttrium
iron garnet (YIG) sphere, which exhibits magnon-phonon coupling via
magnetostriction, with a silica sphere featuring optomechanical
whispering-gallery modes. By tuning the Barnett effect through the magnetic
field direction, our system enables controllable asymmetric EPR steering and
nonreciprocal entanglement between both directly and indirectly coupled modes.
We demonstrate that adjusting the reflectivity of a beam splitter can boost
stationary quantum steering and entanglement, effectively countering thermal
noise. This approach allows for the generation of multipartite entanglement and
both one-way and two-way steering. The proposed system is experimentally
feasible and holds significant promise for various quantum information
applications.

Abstract: Symmetries are a key tool in understanding quantum systems, and, among many
other things, can be exploited to increase the efficiency of numerical
simulations of quantum dynamics. Disordered systems usually feature reduced
symmetries and additionally require averaging over many realizations, making
their numerical study computationally demanding. However, when studying
quantities linear in the time-evolved state, i.e. expectation values of
observables, one can apply the averaging procedure to the time evolution
operator, resulting in an effective dynamical map, which restores symmetry at
the level of super operators. In this work, we develop schemes for efficiently
constructing symmetric sectors of the disorder-averaged dynamical map using
short-time and weak-disorder expansions. To benchmark the method, we apply it
to an Ising model with random all-to-all interactions in the presence of a
transverse field. After disorder averaging, this system becomes effectively
permutation-invariant, and thus the size of the symmetric subspace scales
polynomially in the number of spins allowing for the simulation of large
system.

Result: 无噪声时，QFI和WYSI随淬火时间单调增加；有噪声时，两者呈指数衰减，衰减速率与噪声强度相关。

Conclusion: 噪声显著改变量子相干性动力学，且最大淬火时间与噪声方差线性相关，与量子退火中缺陷最小化的最优时间一致。

Abstract: We study the influence of noise on the dynamics of a transverse field Ising
model when quenched across a quantum critical point. To quantify two-spin
correlations properties, we employ the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and
Wigner-Yanase skew information (WYSI) as measures of quantum coherence. In the
absence of noise, despite the entanglement, both QFI and WYSI increase
monotonically with the ramp quench time, approaching their adiabatic limits
without exhibiting any Kibble-Zurek type scaling with quench duration. When
noise is added to the quench protocol, the coherence dynamics change
dramatically: QFI and WYSI both decay exponentially with time scale of a ramp
quench, with the exponent depending on the noise intensity. Furthermore, the
maximum ramp time, at which either of these measures reach their maximum,
scales linearly with the noise variance, featuring the same exponent that
determines the optimal annealing time for minimizing defect production in noisy
quantum annealing.

Result: 最佳模型在测试集上的Pearson相关系数为0.694，噪声环境下相关性保持稳定。

Conclusion: QCNN在高通量虚拟筛选中具有可行性和噪声容忍性，量子计算可加速药物发现。

Abstract: Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a key computational strategy for
identifying potential drug candidates by estimating the binding free energies
(delta G_bind) of protein-ligand complexes. The immense size of chemical
libraries, combined with the need to account for protein and ligand
conformations as well as ligand translations and rotations, makes these tasks
computationally intensive on classical hardware. This study proposes a quantum
convolutional neural network (QCNN) framework to estimate delta G_bind
efficiently. Using the PDBbind v2020 dataset, we trained QCNN models with 9 and
12 qubits, with the core set designated as the test set. The best-performing
model achieved a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.694 on the test set. To
assess robustness, we introduced quantum noise under two configurations. While
noise increased the root mean square deviation, the Pearson correlation
coefficient remained largely stable. These results demonstrate the feasibility
and noise tolerance of QCNNs for high-throughput virtual screening and
highlight the potential of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.

Conclusion: 该研究为GKP码的魔法态制备提供了一种可行方案，并通过电路QED实现Kerr相互作用，展示了实验可行性。

Abstract: Magic state distillation and injection is a promising strategy towards
universal fault tolerant quantum computation, especially in architectures based
on the bosonic Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes where non-Clifford gates
remain challenging to implement. Here we address GKP magic state preparation by
studying a non-Gaussian unitary mediated by a Kerr interaction which realizes a
logical gate $\sqrt{H}_L$ for square GKP codes. This gate does not directly
involve an auxiliary qubit and is compatible with finite energy constraints on
the code. Fidelity can be further enhanced using the small-Big-small (SBS)
error correction protocol and post-selection, making the scheme robust against
a single photon loss event. We finally propose a circuit QED implementation to
operate the Kerr interaction.

Conclusion: QSVT在模拟中表现优异，但实际硬件需开发更高效的测量算法。

Abstract: This work presents a quantum algorithm for solving linear systems of
equations of the form $\mathbf{A}{\frac{\mathbf{\partial f}}{\mathbf{\partial
x}}} = \mathbf{B}\mathbf{f}$, based on the Quantum Singular Value
Transformation (QSVT). The algorithm uses block-encoding of $A$ and applies an
21st-degree polynomial approximation to the inverse function $f(x) = 1/x$,
enabling relatively shallow quantum circuits implemented on 9 qubits, including
two ancilla qubits, corresponding to a grid size of 128 points. Phase angles
for the QSVT circuit were optimized classically using the Adagrad
gradient-based method over 100 iterations to minimize the solution cost. This
approach was simulated in PennyLane and applied to solve a 1D benchmark case of
Maxwell's equations in free space, with a Gaussian pulse as the initial
condition, where the quantum-computed solution showed high fidelity of more
than 99.9% when compared to the normalized classical solution. Results
demonstrate the potential of QSVT-based linear solvers on simulators with full
quantum state access. However, practical hardware implementations face
challenges because accessing the complete quantum state is infeasible. This
limitation restricts applicability to cases where only $O({poly}(n))$
observables are needed. These findings highlight both the promise and current
limitations of using quantum algorithms, such as QSVT, to solve linear systems
of equations, and they point to the need for the development of
measurement-efficient algorithms for near-term quantum devices.

Abstract: It is widely accepted that quantum error correction is essential for
realizing large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing. Recent experiments have
demonstrated error correction codes operating below threshold, primarily using
local planar codes such as the surface code and color code. In parallel,
theoretical advances in quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes promise
significantly lower overheads, albeit at the cost of requiring non-local parity
checks. While these results are encouraging, implementing such codes remains
challenging for near-term experiments, creating obstacles to holistic
benchmarking of hardware architectures capable of supporting long-range
couplers. In this work, we present a simple construction recipe for small
quantum LDPC codes based on recent developments in the field. Our codes are
approximately twice as efficient as comparable surface codes, yet require only
weight-four parity checks, which simplifies experimental realization compared
to other quantum LDPC codes. We provide concrete proposals for implementations
with superconducting qubits in flip-chip architectures and with semiconductor
spin qubits using shuttling-based approaches.

Motivation: 传统线性异常点（EPs）虽然能增强传感器响应，但会放大噪声，降低信噪比。本文通过非线性方法克服了这一限制。

Method: 将金刚石量子传感器与非线性Van der Pol振荡器耦合，形成自振荡混合系统，利用双稳态转变点的特性。

Result: 在BP附近进行NV磁力测量时，信噪比提升了17倍，灵敏度达到170 fT/√Hz。

Conclusion: 非线性方法在量子传感中实现了突破性进展，解决了EPs物理在高级量子传感中的争议。

Abstract: Phase transitions can dramatically alter system dynamics, unlocking new
behavior and improving performance. Exceptional points (EPs), where the
eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors of a coupled linear system coalesce,
are particularly relevant for sensing applications as they can increase sensor
response to external perturbations to a range of phenomena from optical phase
shifts to gravitational waves. However, the coalescence of eigenstates at
linear EPs amplifies noise, negating the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
enhancement. Here, we overcome this limitation using nonlinearity, which
exhibits exceptional SNR around a bistable transition point (BP). We couple a
state-of-the-art diamond quantum sensor to a nonlinear Van der Pol oscillator,
forming a self-oscillating hybrid system that exhibits both a single-valued and
bistable phase. The boundaries between these phases are marked by both
adiabatic and deterministic non-adiabatic transitions that enable chiral state
switching and state coalescence at the BP. Crucially, NV magnetometry performed
near the BP exhibits a 17x enhancement in SNR, achieving a record sensitivity
of 170 fT/\sqrt{Hz}. This result surpasses the sensitivity limit of an ideal,
thermally-limited electron magnetometer and resolves a long-standing debate
regarding EP-like physics in advanced quantum sensing.

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have demonstrated immense potential in
synthesizing diverse and high-fidelity images. However, critical questions
remain unanswered regarding how quantum principles might best enhance their
representational and computational capacity. In this paper, we investigate
hybrid quantum-classical GAN architectures supplemented by transfer learning to
systematically examine whether incorporating Variational Quantum Circuits
(VQCs) into the generator, the discriminator, or both improves performance over
a fully classical baseline. Our findings indicate that fully hybrid models,
which incorporate VQCs in both the generator and the discriminator,
consistently produce images of higher visual quality and achieve more favorable
quantitative metrics compared to their fully classical counterparts. In
particular, VQCs in the generator accelerate early feature learning, whereas
those in the discriminator, despite exhibiting slower initial convergence,
ultimately facilitate more refined synthetic outputs. Moreover, the model
sustains near-comparable performance even when the dataset size is drastically
reduced, suggesting that transfer learning and quantum enhancements mitigate
the problem of data scarcity. Overall, the results underscore that carefully
integrating quantum computing with classical adversarial training and
pretrained feature extraction can considerably enrich GAN-based image
synthesis. These insights open avenues for future work on higher-resolution
tasks, alternative quantum circuit designs, and experimentation with emerging
quantum hardware.

Abstract: Decoherence due to radiative decay remains an important consideration in
scaling superconducting quantum processors. We introduce a passive,
interference-based methodology for suppressing radiative decay using only the
intrinsic multi-mode structured environment of superconducting circuits. By
taking into account the full electromagnetic mode-mode couplings within the
device, we derive analytic conditions that enable destructive interference.
These conditions are realized by introducing controlled geometric asymmetries
-- such as localized perturbations to the transmon capacitor -- which increase
mode hybridization and activate interference between multiple decay pathways.
We validate this methodology using perturbation theory, full-wave
electromagnetic simulations, and experimental measurements of a symmetry-broken
transmon qubit with improved coherence times.

Abstract: We investigate the sequential composition of weak values in the framework of
time-symmetric quantum mechanics. Specifically, we consider a forward'' weak
measurement from a preselected state $\ket{\psi}$ to a post-selected state
$\ket{\phi}$, followed by a reverse'' weak measurement. We show that the
product of these two weak values corresponds to the normalized expectation
value of a strong, state-conditioned observable $B = A P_\psi A$, where $P_\psi
= \ket{\psi}\bra{\psi}$ is the projector onto the preselected state. Analyzing
the structure of $B$, we demonstrate how it encodes interference information,
particularly when $\ket{\psi}$ is a superposition rather than an eigenstate of
$A$. This formulation extends naturally to mixed states by replacing $P_\psi$
with a generic density matrix $\rho$, linking the construction to the formalism
of generalized quantum measurements. We illustrate practical applications in
quantum information, including state-specific error witnessing in quantum

Conclusion: 该方法显著优于qubit实现，尤其在问题规模增大时优势更明显。

Abstract: Decomposing unitary operations into native gates is an essential step for
implementing quantum algorithms. For qubit-based devices, where native gates
are typically single- and two-qubit operations, a range of decomposition
techniques have been developed. In particular, efficient algorithms exist for
decomposing exponentials of Pauli strings while taking hardware topology in
account. Motivated by the growing interest in qutrit-based quantum computing,
we develop analogous decomposition methods for qutrit systems. Specifically, we
introduce an algorithm that decomposes the exponential of an arbitrary tensor
product of Weyl-Heisenberg operators (plus their Hermitian conjugation) into
single- and two-qutrit gates. We further extend this approach to unitaries
generated by Gell-Mann string (i.e., a tensor product of Gell-Mann matrices).
Since both Gell-Mann matrices and Weyl-Heisenberg operators form (together with
identity) complete operator bases of qutrit operators, we can use this result
also to decompose any multi-qutrit gate that is diagonal up to single-qutrit
rotations. As a practical application, we use our method to decompose the
layers of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm for qutrit-based
implementations of the graph k-coloring problem. For values of $k$ well-suited
to qutrit architectures (e.g., $k=3$ or in general $k=3^n$), our approach
yields significantly shallower circuits compared to qubit-based
implementations, an advantage that grows with problem size, while also
requiring a smaller total Hilbert space dimension. Finally, we also address the
routing challenge in qutrit architectures that arises due to the limited
connectivity of the devices. In particular, we generalize the Steiner-Gauss
method, originally developed to reduce CNOT counts in qubit circuit, to
optimize gate routing in qutrit-based systems.

Motivation: 经典LQG方法计算复杂度高（$\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$），随着系统维度增加，计算成本急剧上升。量子算法有望提供更高效的计算方案。

Method: 利用量子线性代数原语（如块编码矩阵表示和量子奇异值变换QSVT）重新设计LQG流程，包括矩阵求逆和乘法。

Result: 在标准假设下，量子LQG算法的时间复杂度与系统维度$n$呈多对数关系，与时间范围$T$呈线性关系，实现了对经典方法的量子加速。

Conclusion: 量子算法在LQG问题上具有显著的计算优势，为高维系统控制提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for solving the finite-horizon discrete-time
Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) control problem, which integrates optimal
control and state estimation in the presence of stochastic disturbances and
noise. Classical approaches to LQG require solving a backward Riccati recursion
and a forward Kalman filter, both requiring computationally expensive matrix
operations with overall time complexity $\mathcal{O}(T n^3)$, where $n$ is the
system dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. While efficient classical solvers
exist, especially for small to medium-sized systems, their computational
complexity grows rapidly with system dimension. To address this, we reformulate
the full LQG pipeline using quantum linear algebra primitives, including
block-encoded matrix representations and quantum singular value transformation
(QSVT) techniques for matrix inversion and multiplication. We formally analyze
the time complexity of each algorithmic component. Under standard assumptions
on matrix condition numbers and encoding precision, the total runtime of the
quantum LQG algorithm scales polylogarithmically with the system dimension $n$
and linearly with the time horizon $T$, offering an asymptotic quantum speedup
over classical methods.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement is a key resource for quantum technologies, yet its
efficient and high-fidelity generation remains a challenge due to the
complexity of quantum dynamics. This paper presents a quantum optimal control
framework to maximize bipartite entanglement within a fixed time horizon, under
bounded control inputs. By leveraging Pontryagin's Minimum Principle, we derive
a set of necessary conditions that guide the design of time-dependent control
fields to steer a two-qubit system toward maximally entangled Bell states. The
entanglement is quantified using concurrence, and the control objective is
formulated as maximizing this measure at the terminal time. Our approach is
validated through numerical simulations of Liouville-von Neumann dynamics. The
results demonstrate the effectiveness of switching-based control strategies in
achieving robust entanglement, offering insights into practical implementations
of quantum control for entanglement generation in quantum networks.

quantities expressed through generalized matrices. Furthermore, we reconfirm
that a multiple commutator involving generalized matrices can serve as a
discrete (quantized) version of the Nambu bracket or the Jacobian.

Abstract: We evaluated a multi-color two-photon entangled state generated in silicon
via spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) as a potential source for bosonic
integrated circuits. Spatially entangled photon states were created using a
pair of silicon waveguides that produced signal and idler photons through SFWM,
allowing us to observe quantum interference between them. Assuming that the
frequencies of the multi-color photons were nearly identical, we characterized
the generated quantum state by performing quantum state tomography on the
bosonic system using a linear optical circuit. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of using photon-pair sources generated in silicon via SFWM in
bosonic optical circuits and highlights their potential for a wide range of
applications in silicon-based optical quantum technologies.

Abstract: Paramount for performances of quantum network applications are the structure
and quality of distributed entanglement. Here we propose a scalable and
efficient approach to reveal the topological information of unknown quantum
networks, and quantify entanglement simultaneously. The scheme exploits
entropic uncertainty, an operationally meaningful measure of correlation, by
performing only two local measurements on each qubit. Moreover, when
measurement outcomes in each node are collectively evaluated, integrating
uncertainty and mutual information enables a direct count of the number of
bipartite sources between any two nodes. This surpasses what is possible via
applying either approach solely. Moreover, quantum error mitigation techniques
including probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) and virtual distillation (VD),
which have been widely applied to suppress biases in single expectation value,
are further incorporated to mitigate errors in entropic quantities. We find
that PEC successfully removes deviations in correlation estimations. Meanwhile,
VD extends the depolarizing noise strength that allows for valid bipartite
entanglement certification from 8.8% to 26.4%, thus substantially enhancing
robustness against bias-inducing noise in practical situations. The proposal is
applicable to a broad variety of platforms and helps to spur future studies
toward harnessing the advantages of quantum networks.

Abstract: A microwave-optical transducer of sufficiently low noise and high signal
transfer rate would allow entanglement to be distributed between
superconducting quantum processors at a rate faster than the lifetimes of the
quantum memories being linked. Here we present measurements of a membrane-based
opto-electromechanical transducer with high signal throughput, as quantified by
an efficiency-bandwidth-duty-cycle product of 7 kHz, approaching
quantum-enabled operation in upconversion as well as downconversion, with
input-referred added noise of 3 photons. In downconversion, throughput of this
magnitude at the few-photon noise level is unprecedented. Using the quantum
channel capacity, we also find an expression for the maximum rate at which
quantum information can be transduced, providing insight into the importance of
improving both a transducer's throughput and noise performance. With feasible
improvements, the high throughput achieved with this device positions
membrane-based transducers as a strategic choice for demonstrations of a
quantum network with reasonable averaging times.

Abstract: Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.

Result: 本体论解释能够一致且自然地解释量子不确定性，而认识论解释在解决自然内在约束方面存在不足。

Conclusion: 支持量子波函数的本体论解释，认为其更符合量子力学的核心特征。

Abstract: The ontological status of the quantum wavefunction remains one of the most
debated questions in quantum theory. While epistemic interpretations regard the
wavefunction as a reflection of our knowledge or beliefs, ontic interpretations
treat it as a real physical object. In this paper, we argue that epistemic
approaches struggle to explain the universality and precision of the
uncertainty principle, a core feature of quantum mechanics. By contrast,
treating the wave-function as ontic allows a consistent and natural derivation
of quantum uncertainty from the mathematical structure of Hilbert space. We
examine key interpretations on both sides and highlight why the epistemic view
falls short in addressing constraints that appear to be intrinsic to nature.

Conclusion: DIPQRB为不可信设备生成安全私密随机数提供了实用且经济的解决方案。

Abstract: Device-independent quantum random number generation (DIQRNG) is the gold
standard for generating truly random numbers, as it can produce certifiably
random numbers from untrusted devices. However, the stringent device
requirements of traditional DIQRNG protocols have limited their practical
applications. Here, we introduce Device-Independent Private Quantum Randomness
Beacon (DIPQRB), a novel approach to generate random numbers from untrusted
devices based on routed Bell tests. This method significantly relaxes the
device requirements, enabling a more practical way of generating randomness
from untrusted devices. By distributing the device requirements across a
network of servers and clients, our proposal allows the server to operate
high-performance devices while the clients can be equipped with more
cost-effective devices. Moreover, the outputs of the client's device are also
private, even against the server, which is essential in cryptographic
applications. Therefore, DIPQRB provides a cost-effective method to generate
secure and private random numbers from untrusted devices.

Conclusion: 量子限制是根本性的，设计测量代理时需考虑量子干涉效应。

Abstract: Heat and work in thermodynamics refer to the measurement of changes in energy
content of external bodies (baths and agents). We discuss the implications of
quantum mechanics on the possibility to measure work in a mesoscopic context.
The agent is a quantum entity (say an oscillator) that is used to drive the
system. An obvious limitation is related to back-reaction, leading to a
classical-like restriction. We find that in order to resolve fingerprints of
interference an additional quantum uncertainty limitation should be taken into
account in the design of the agent. The quantum limitation is fundamental, and
cannot be relaxed by super-resolution techniques.

Abstract: As we approach the centennial anniversary of modern quantum mechanics this
paper revisits the foundational debates through a new poll within the research
community. Inspired by the survey by Schlosshauer, Kofler, and Zeilinger at the
specialized 2011 Quantum Physics and the Nature of Reality conference, we
expanded our recruitment to include a more representative sample of the broader
community of physicists with the aim to reveal potential shifts in scientists'
views and compare our findings with those from several previous polls. While
quantum foundations still lack a consensus interpretation, our results indicate
a persistent preference for the Copenhagen interpretation. This enduring
support likely reflects both the educational emphasis on the Copenhagen
interpretation and its pragmatic appeal in avoiding complex metaphysical
questions and introducing new notions (e.g., other worlds or the pilot wave).
Our findings thus underscore the relative stability of interpretational
preferences over the past decades.

Abstract: In this paper we develop a mathematical framework for indiscernibility of
quantum states, arguing that, given a set of observables, the ``distinguishable
objects'' are the equivalence classes modulo indiscernibility relative to the
observables. The structure of the set of distinguishable objects - called the
Holevo space - is investigated in detail, and it is shown that the observables
admit a natural lift to continuous functions on the Holevo space. The theory is
illustrated by several examples where the ``distinguishable objects'' can be
described explicitly. Among other things, the Holevo spaces and the lifted
functions are described for position measurements on a free particle and for
spin measurements in the EPR and Bell experiments.

Result: 数值结果未显示APS猜想被违反的证据。

Conclusion: APS猜想在Henning-Yeo图上可能成立，但需进一步验证。

Abstract: The maximum energy of the EPR model on a weighted graph is known to be
upper-bounded by the sum of the total weight and the value of maximum-weight
fractional matching~(MWFM). Recently, Apte, Parekh and Sud~(APS) conjecture
that the bound could be strengthened by replacing MWFM with maximum weight
matching~(MWM). Here we test this conjecture on a special class of regular
graphs that Henning and Yeo constructed many years ago. On this class of
regular graphs, MWMs achieve tight lower bounds. As for the maximum energy of
the EPR model, we have recently devised a new algorithm called Fractional
Entanglement Distribution~(FED) based on quasi-homogeneous fractional
matchings, which could achieve rather high accuracy. Applying the FED algorithm
to the EPR model on Henning-Yeo graphs, we could thus obtain energy as high as
possible and matching value as low as possible, and then make high-precision
tests of the APS conjecture. Nevertheless, our numerical results do not show
any evidence that the APS conjecture could be violated.

Motivation: 研究目的是为了在量子多体系统中实现热力学一致的描述，特别是在能量级间距消失的系统中，传统方法（如secular近似）失效的情况下。

Method: 通过推导一个不依赖于secular近似的量子主方程，分析了二次系统与独立相同浴耦合的情况。

Result: 发现准局域Redfield方程与Davies方程完全一致，这是由于每个浴产生的量子相干性相互抵消。

Conclusion: 这一结果为量子多体系统的热力学一致描述提供了新的途径，并可推广到缓慢驱动的二次系统和一般量子多体系统。

Abstract: We derive a thermodynamically consistent quantum master equation that
satisfies locality for quadratic systems coupled to independent and identical
baths at each site. We show that the quasi-local Redfield equation coincides
exactly with the Davies equation, which satisfies the detailed-balance
condition, due to cancellation of quantum coherence generated by each bath.
This derivation does not rely on the secular approximation, which fails in
systems with vanishing energy-level spacings. We discuss generalizations of our
result to slowly driven quadratic systems and generic quantum many-body
systems. Our result paves the way to a thermodynamically consistent description
of quantum many-body systems.

Abstract: Constructing large-scale quantum resources is an important foundation for
further improving the efficiency and scalability of quantum communication.
Here, we present an efficient extraction and stable control scheme of 40 pairs
of entangled sideband modes from the squeezed light by specially designing
optical parametric oscillator. Utilizing the low-loss optical frequency comb
control technology and the local cross-correlation algorithm, we model and
manage the efficient separation process of the entangled sidebands modes
facilitated by the optical filtering cavities, a maximum entanglement level of
6.5 dB is achieved. The feasibility of large-capacity quantum dense coding
based on these entangled sideband modes is proved experimentally, which is of
great significance for optimizing the utilization of quantum resources, thereby
contributing to the advancement of large-capacity quantum communication
networks and enabling the realization of more secure and efficient quantum
communication systems.

Abstract: We present a systematic study of how quantum circuit design, specifically the
depth of the variational ansatz and the choice of quantum feature mapping,
affects the performance of hybrid quantum-classical neural networks on a causal
classification task. The architecture combines a convolutional neural network
for classical feature extraction with a parameterized quantum circuit acting as
the quantum layer. We evaluate multiple ansatz depths and nine different
feature maps. Results show that increasing the number of ansatz repetitions
improves generalization and training stability, though benefits tend to plateau
beyond a certain depth. The choice of feature mapping is even more critical:
only encodings with multi-axis Pauli rotations enable successful learning,
while simpler maps lead to underfitting or loss of class separability.
Principal Component Analysis and silhouette scores reveal how data
distributions evolve across network stages. These findings offer practical
guidance for designing quantum circuits in hybrid models. All source codes and
evaluation tools are publicly available.

Conclusion: 该方法为未来仲裁量子签名协议的发展提供了新思路。

Abstract: Quantum digital signatures ensure unforgeable message authenticity and
integrity using quantum principles, offering unconditional security against
both classical and quantum attacks. They are crucial for secure communication
in high-stakes environments, ensuring trust and long-term protection in the
quantum era. Nowadays, the majority of arbitrated quantum signature (AQS)
protocols encrypt data qubit by qubit using the quantum one-time pad (QOTP).
Despite providing robust data encryption, QOTP is not a good fit for AQS
because of its susceptibility to many types of attacks. In this work, we
present an efficient AQS protocol to encrypt quantum message ensembles using a
distinct encryption technique, the chained controlled unitary operations. In
contrast to existing protocols, our approach successfully prevents disavowal
and forgery attacks. We hope this contributes to advancing future
investigations into the development of AQS protocols.

Abstract: The tunneling effect driven by waveform-controlled laser pulses is a
cornerstone of attosecond science and contributes decisively to its extreme
time resolution. In the spatial domain, electron tunneling through a
bias-driven junction between a nanotip and a surface enables atomic-scale
spatial resolution in scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Recently, first
signatures of attosecond modulation of STM currents have shown that
simultaneous attosecond-nanometer resolution is feasible. However, while
sub-cycle attosecond dynamics are routinely controlled and determined with high
precision, controlling the direction of the currents and determining their
duration have remained elusive in STM. Here, we induce STM tunneling currents
using two-color laser pulses and dynamically control their direction, relying
solely on the sub-cycle waveform of the pulses. Projecting our measurement data
onto numerical and analytical solutions of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger
equation reveals non-adiabatic tunneling as the underlying physical mechanism,
yielding current burst durations on the order of 900 as. Despite working under
ambient conditions but free from thermal artifacts, we achieve a lateral
spatial resolution of 2 nm and sub-angstr\"om topographic sensitivity.
Directional control of attosecond bursts in STM will enable triggering and
detecting ultrafast charge dynamics in molecular systems and defect states at
the spatio-temporal frontier of microscopy.

Abstract: Non-Gaussian states are essential resources in quantum information

non-Gaussianity in many-body systems. Building on recent theoretical insights
into the self-convolution properties of bosonic pure states, we introduce
non-Gaussian entropy as a new measure to characterize non-Gaussianity in
bosonic pure states. We further propose a practical protocol for measuring
non-Gaussian entropy using three beam splitters and four copies of the input
state. In addition, we extend this framework to mixed states, providing a
general approach to quantifying non-Gaussianity. Our results offer a convenient
and efficient method for characterizing bosonic non-Gaussianity, paving the way
for its implementation on near-term experimental platforms.

Method: 通过电路QED模型进行系统研究，分析不同耦合强度下的传输机制。

Result: 发现整流效应随耦合强度变化，甚至反转；非线性传输中电流与温度偏置的关系受耦合强度影响。

Conclusion: 耦合强度是决定热传输和整流效应的关键因素，稳态相干性抑制电流但增强整流。

Abstract: A qubit-oscillator junction connecting as a series two bosonic heat baths at
different temperatures can display heat valve and diode effects. In particular,
the rectification can change in magnitude and even in sign, implying an
inversion of the preferential direction for the heat current with respect to
the temperature bias. We perform a systematic study of these effects in a
circuit QED model of qubit-oscillator system and find that the features of
current and rectification crucially depend on the qubit-oscillator coupling.
While at small coupling, transport occurs via a resonant mechanism between the
sub-systems, in the ultrastrong coupling regime the junction is a unique,
highly hybridized system and the current becomes largely insensitive to the
detuning. Correspondingly, the rectification undergoes a change of sign. In the
nonlinear transport regime, the coupling strength determines whether the
current scales sub- or super-linearly with the temperature bias and whether the
rectification, which increases in magnitude with the bias, is positive or
negative. We also find that steady-state coherence largely suppresses the
current and enhances rectification. An insight on these behaviors with respect
to changes in the system parameters is provided by analytical approximate
formulas.

Abstract: Quantum speed-ups for dynamical simulation usually demand unitary
time-evolution, whereas the large ODE/PDE systems encountered in realistic
physical models are generically non-unitary. We present a universal
moment-fulfilling dilation that embeds any linear, non-Hermitian flow $\dot x =
A x$ with $A=-iH+K$ into a strictly unitary evolution on an enlarged Hilbert
space: \[
  ( (l| \otimes I )
  \mathcal T e^{-i \int ( I_A\otimes H +i F\otimes K) dt}
  ( |r) \otimes I )
  = \mathcal T e^{\int A dt}, \] provided the triple $( F, (l|, |r) )$
satisfies the compact moment identities $(l| F^{k}|r) =1$ for all $k\ge 0$ in
the ancilla space. This algebraic criterion recovers both
\emph{Schr\"odingerization} [Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 230602 (2024)] and the
linear-combination-of-Hamiltonians (LCHS) scheme [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 150603
(2023)], while also unveiling whole families of new dilations built from
differential, integral, pseudo-differential, and difference generators. Each
family comes with a continuous tuning parameter \emph{and} is closed under
similarity transformations that leave the moments invariant, giving rise to an
overwhelming landscape of design space that allows quantum dilations to be
co-optimized for specific applications, algorithms, and hardware.
  As concrete demonstrations, we prove that a simple finite-difference dilation
in a finite interval attains near-optimal oracle complexity. Numerical
experiments on Maxwell viscoelastic wave propagation confirm the accuracy and
robustness of the approach.

Abstract: Excited states play a central role in determining the physical properties of
quantum matter, yet their accurate computation in many-body systems remains a
formidable challenge for numerical methods. While neural quantum states have
delivered outstanding results for ground-state problems, extending their
applicability to excited states has faced limitations, including instability in
dense spectra and reliance on symmetry constraints or penalty-based
formulations. In this work, we rigorously formalize the framework introduced by
Pfau et al.~\cite{pfau2024accurate} in terms of Grassmann geometry of the
Hilbert space. This allows us to generalize the Stochastic Reconfiguration
method for the simultaneous optimization of multiple variational wave
functions, and to introduce the multidimensional versions of operator variances
and overlaps. We validate our approach on the Heisenberg quantum spin model on
the square lattice, achieving highly accurate energies and physical observables
for a large number of excited states.

Abstract: Understanding how a quantum many-body state is maintained stably as a
nonequilibrium steady state is of fundamental and practical importance for
exploration and exploitation of open quantum systems. We establish a general
equivalent condition for an open quantum many-body system governed by the
Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad dynamics under local drive and/or
dissipation to have a quantum independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
steady state. We present a sufficient condition for a system to have a quantum
i.i.d. steady state by identifying a set of operators that commute with
arbitrary quantum i.i.d. states. In particular, a set of quantum i.i.d. states
is found to be an invariant subset of time evolution superoperators for systems
that satisfy the sufficient condition. These findings not only identify a class
of models with exactly solvable steady states but also lead to a no-go theorem
that precludes quantum entanglement and spatial correlations in a broad class
of quantum many-body steady states in a dissipative environment.

Abstract: We present a method to suppress crosstalk from implementing controlled-Z
gates via local addressing in neutral atom quantum computers. In these systems,
a fraction of the laser light that is applied locally to implement gates
typically leaks to other atoms. We analyze the resulting crosstalk in a setup
of two gate atoms and one neighboring third atom. We then perturbatively derive
a spin-echo-inspired gate protocol that suppresses the leading order of the
amplitude error, which dominates the crosstalk. Numerical simulations
demonstrate that our gate protocol improves the fidelity by two orders of
magnitude across a broad range of experimentally relevant parameters. To
further reduce the infidelity, we develop a circuit to cancel remaining phase
errors. Our results pave the way for using local addressing for high-fidelity
quantum gates on Rydberg-based quantum computers.

Conclusion: 该模型在QKD、TCSPC、LIDAR等领域有广泛应用潜力，并适用于其他死区时间受限的探测器。

Abstract: Current count-rate models for single-photon avalanche diodes (SPADs)
typically assume an instantaneous recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time, leading to a systematic overestimation of the effective detection
efficiency for high photon flux. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a
generalized analytical count-rate model for free-running SPADs that models the
non-instantaneous, exponential recovery of the quantum efficiency following
dead-time. Our model, framed within the theory of non-homogeneous Poisson
processes, only requires one additional detector parameter -- the
exponential-recovery time constant $\tau_\mathrm{r}$. The model accurately
predicts detection statistics deep into the saturation regime, outperforming
the conventional step-function model by two orders of magnitude in terms of the
impinging photon rate. For extremely high photon flux, we further extend the
model to capture paralyzation effects. Beyond photon flux estimation, our model
simplifies SPAD characterization by enabling the extraction of quantum
efficiency $\eta_0$, dead-time $\tau_\mathrm{d}$, and recovery time constant
$\tau_\mathrm{r}$ from a single inter-detection interval histogram. This can be
achieved with a simple setup, without the need for pulsed lasers or externally
gated detectors. We anticipate broad applicability of our model in quantum key
distribution (QKD), time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC), LIDAR, and
related areas. Furthermore, the model is readily adaptable to other types of
dead-time-limited detectors. A Python implementation is provided as
supplementary material for swift adoption.

Abstract: Classical Shadow Tomography (Huang, Kueng and Preskill, Nature Physics 2020)
is a method for creating a classical snapshot of an unknown quantum state,
which can later be used to predict the value of an a-priori unknown observable
on that state. In the short time since their introduction, classical shadows
received a lot of attention from the physics, quantum information, and quantum
computing (including cryptography) communities. In particular there has been a
major effort focused on improving the efficiency, and in particular depth, of
generating the classical snapshot.
  Existing constructions rely on a distribution of unitaries as a central
building block, and research is devoted to simplifying this family as much as
possible. We diverge from this paradigm and show that suitable distributions
over \emph{states} can be used as the building block instead. Concretely, we
create the snapshot by entangling the unknown input state with an independently
prepared auxiliary state, and measuring the resulting entangled state. This
state-based approach allows us to consider a building block with arguably
weaker properties that has not been studied so far in the context of classical
shadows. Notably, our cryptographically-inspired analysis shows that for
\emph{efficiently computable} observables, it suffices to use
\emph{pseudorandom} families of states. To the best of our knowledge,
\emph{computational} classical shadow tomography was not considered in the
literature prior to our work.
  Finally, in terms of efficiency, the online part of our method (i.e.\ the
part that depends on the input) is simply performing a measurement in the Bell
basis, which can be done in constant depth using elementary gates.

Abstract: In this work we present a comprehensive method of characterization and
optimization of laser irradiation within a confocal microscope tailored to
quantum sensing experiments using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres. While confocal
microscopy is well-suited for such experiments, precise control and
understanding of several optical parameters are essential for reliable
single-emitter studies. We investigate the laser beam intensity profile,
single-photon emission statistics, fluorescence response under varying
polarization and saturation conditions, spectral characteristics, and the
temporal profiles of readout and reinitialization pulses. The beam quality is
assessed using the beam propagation factor $M^2$, determined via the razorblade
technique. Optical fluorescence spectrum is recorded to confirm NV centre
emission. To confirm single-emitter operation, we measure second-order
autocorrelation function $g^{(2)}(\tau)$. Saturation behaviour is analysed by
varying laser power and recording the corresponding fluorescence, while
polarization dependence is studied using a half-wave ($\lambda/2$) plate.
Temporal laser pulse profile is examined by modulating the power of an
acousto-optic modulator. After optimizing all relevant parameters, we
demonstrate the microscope's capabilities in driving spin transitions of a
single NV centre. This work establishes a straightforward and effective
protocol for laser excitation optimization, enhancing the performance and
reliability of NV-based quantum sensors.

Conclusion: 该研究首次建立了CE码的完整FTQEC框架，证明了其对相干噪声的鲁棒性，为相干噪声主导的量子处理器提供了潜在解决方案。

Abstract: Collective coherent noise poses challenges for fault-tolerant quantum error
correction (FTQEC), as it falls outside the usual stochastic noise models.
While constant excitation (CE) codes can naturally avoid coherent noise, a
complete fault-tolerant framework for the use of these codes under realistic
noise models has been elusive. Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant
architecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing
that transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce
CE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome
extraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.
This enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with
CE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm
that efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using
our framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and
$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong
performance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete
FTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.
This highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum
processors dominated by collective coherent noise.

Abstract: We investigate the response of a Ramsey interferometric quantum sensor based
on a frustrated, three-spin system (a Kitaev trimer) to a classical
time-dependent field (signal). The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a
critical point, $|\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying
approximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear
dependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial
states, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that
below a threshold, $|\vec{b}| < b_\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to
the signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the
signal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately
omnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor
configuration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such
detectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a
noise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum
bubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and

Abstract: This work provides a rigorous and self-contained introduction to numerical
methods for Hamiltonian simulation in quantum computing, with a focus on
high-order product formulas for efficiently approximating the time evolution of
quantum systems. Aimed at students and researchers seeking a clear mathematical
treatment, the study begins with the foundational principles of quantum
mechanics and quantum computation before presenting the Lie-Trotter product
formula and its higher-order generalizations. In particular, Suzuki's recursive
method is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical
analysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these
techniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local
Hamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks.
The work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open
challenges in Hamiltonian simulation.

Abstract: This work classifies stabilizer codes by the set of diagonal Clifford gates
that can be implemented transversally on them. We show that, for any stabilizer
code, its group of diagonal transversal Clifford gates on $\ell$ code blocks
must be one of six distinct families of matrix groups. We further develop the
theory of classifying stabilizer codes by via matrix algebras of endomorphisms
first introduced by Rains, and give a complete classification of the diagonal
Clifford symmetries of $\ell$ code blocks. A number of corollaries are given in
the final section.
