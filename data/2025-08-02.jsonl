Typically, periodically driven\nsystems in the absence of conservation laws thermalize to a featureless\n\"infinite-temperature\" state, erasing all memory of their initial conditions.\nHowever, this paradigm can break down through mechanisms such as integrability,\nmany-body localization, quantum many-body scars, and Hilbert space\nfragmentation. Here, we report the experimental observation of dynamical\nfreezing, a distinct mechanism of thermalization breakdown in driven systems,\nand demonstrate its application in quantum sensing using an ensemble of\napproximately $10^4$ interacting nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond. By\nprecisely controlling the driving frequency and detuning, we observe emergent\nlong-lived spin magnetization and coherent oscillatory micromotions, persisting\nover timescales exceeding the interaction-limited coherence time ($T_2$) by\nmore than an order of magnitude.

As a first example,\nwe investigate the two-dimensional classical $N$-state clock model as a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ FD of the $U(1)$-symmetric $XY$-model. Using effective field\ntheory, we employ the RG to derive generalized scaling hypotheses involving the\nFD parameter $N$, which allows us to relate data obtained for different\n$N$-regularized models in a procedure that we term $\\textit{field digitization\nscaling}$ (FDS). Using numerical tensor-network calculations at finite bond\ndimension $\\chi$, we further uncover an unconventional universal crossover\naround a low-temperature phase transition induced by finite $N$, demonstrating\nthat FDS can be extended to describe the interplay of $\\chi$ and $N$.

Consequently, quantum circuits are\ntheoretically capable of supporting large scale parallel computation.

Experts\ngenerally believe that quantum computing relies on matrix operations, which are\ndeterministic in nature without randomness. This inherent determinism makes it\nparticularly challenging to design quantum circuits that require random number\ninjection. JP Morgan[1] introduced the piecewise linear (PWL) approach for\nmodeling payoff computations but did not disclose a quantum circuit capable of\nidentifying values exceeding the strike price, suggesting a possible reliance\non classical pre processing for interval classification. This paper presents an\nintegrated quantum circuit with two key components: one for random number\ninjection, applicable to risk assessment, and the other for direct payoff\ncomputation, relevant to financial pricing.

For algorithms with deep circuits - such as\niterative quantum algorithms involving multiple oracle calls - ZNE's\neffectiveness is significantly degraded under high noise.

We then propose a co-design of circuit layers and qubit routing by\nembedding the derived swap networks within layered, connectivity-aware\nans\\\"atze. This construction significantly improves the trainability of the\nansatz, leading to enhanced performance with reduced resources. We showcase\nthese improvements through ground-state simulations of strongly correlated\nsystems, including spin-glass and molecular electronic structure models. Across\nexemplified connectivities, the swap-enhanced ansatz consistently achieves\nlower energy errors using fewer entangling gates, shallower circuits, and fewer\nparameters than standard layered-structured baselines. Our results indicate\nthat swap network augmented ans\\\"atze provide enhanced trainability and\nresource-efficient design to capture complex correlations on devices with\nconstrained qubit connectivity."}

The Hadamard test is hard to implement\nbecause it requires controlled applications of $U^{k}$. Recently, a Sequential\nHadamard test (SHT) was proposed (arXiv:2506.18765) which requires controlled\napplication of $U$ only but its total run time $T_{\\rm tot}$ scales as\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{3}/\\epsilon^{2}r_{\\rm min}^{2})$ where $r_{\\rm min}$ is the\nminimum value of $|\\langle \\psi|U^{k'}|\\psi\\rangle|$ among all integers $k'\n\\leq k$. Typically $r_{\\rm min}$ is exponentially low and SHT becomes too slow.\nWe present a new algorithm, the SANDWICH test to address this bottleneck. Our\nalgorithm uses efficient preparation of the initial state $|\\psi\\rangle$ to\nefficiently implement the SPROTIS operator $R_{\\psi}^{\\phi}$ where SPROTIS\nstands for the Selective Phase Rotation of the Initial State. It sandwiches the\nSPROTIS operator between $U^{a}$ and $U^{b}$ for integers $\\{a,b\\} \\leq k$ to\nestimate $\\langle \\psi|U^{k}|\\psi\\rangle$. The total run time $T_{\\rm tot}$ is\n$\\mathcal{O}(k^{2}\\ln k/ \\epsilon^{2} s_{\\rm min}^{6})$. Here $s_{\\rm min}$ is\nthe minimum value of $|\\langle \\psi|U^{\\hat{k}}|\\psi\\rangle$ among all integers\n$\\hat{k}$ which are values of the nodes of a random binary sum tree whose root\nnode value is $k$ and leaf nodes' values are $1$ or $0$. It can be reasonably\nexpected that $s_{\\rm min} \\not\\ll 1$ in typical cases because there is wide\nfreedom in choosing the random binary sum tree."}

In this article, we present numerical evidence that the presence of\nquantum scars is a microscopic ingredient that enables and enhances\nnon-Markovianity of the dynamics of subsystems. We exemplify this with the PXP\nmodel and its deformations which either enhance or erase the signatures of\nscarred dynamics when quenched from a simple product state that is known to\nhave significant overlaps with the scarred subspace in the spectrum. By probing\ninformation backflows with the dynamical behaviour of the distances between\ntemporally-separated states of small subsystems, systematic signatures of\nsubsystem non-Markovianity in these models are presented, and it is seen that\nscarring-enhancing (erasing) deformations also exhibit enhanced (diminished)\nsubsystem non-Markovianity. This sheds new light on the dynamical memories\nassociated with quantum scarring, and opens interesting new questions at the\ninterface of quantum scarring and an open quantum systems approach to\ninvestigating far-from-equilibrium and non-thermalizing isolated quantum\nmany-body systems."}

Designing\nnext-generation quantum devices, therefore, depends on solving the following\nquestion: which resources, and in what amount, are required to implement a\ndesired quantum process? Casting the problem in the language of quantum\nresource theories, we prove a universal cost-irreversibility tradeoff: the\nlower the irreversibility of a quantum process, the greater the required\nresource cost for its realization. The trade-off law holds for a broad range of\nresources -- energy, magic, asymmetry, coherence, athermality, and others --\nyielding lower bounds on resource cost of any quantum channel. Its broad scope\npositions this result as a foundation for deriving the following key results:\n(1) we show a universal relation between the energetic cost and the\nirreversibility for arbitrary channels, encompassing the energy-error tradeoff\nfor any measurement or unitary gate; (2) we extend the energy-error tradeoff to\nfree energy and work costs; (3) we extend the Wigner-Araki-Yanase theorem,\nwhich is the universal limitation on measurements under conservation laws, to a\nwide class of resource theories: the probability of failure in distinguishing\nresourceful states via a measurement is inversely proportional to its resource\ncost; (4) we prove that infinitely many resource-non-increasing operations in\nfact require an infinite implementation cost. These findings reveal a universal\nrelationship between quantumness and irreversibility, providing a first step\ntoward a general theory that explains when -- and how -- quantumness can\nsuppress irreversibility."}

In this work, we exploit the\nnon-deterministic fusion of non-Abelian anyons to inform active error\ncorrection and design decoders where the fusion products, instead of flag\nqubits, herald the noise. This intrinsic heralding enhances thresholds over\nthose of Abelian counterparts when noise is dominated by a single non-Abelian\nanyon type. Furthermore, we present an approach for determining the optimal\nthreshold for non-Abelian TOs with perfect anyon syndromes for any noise model,\nformulated as a statistical mechanics model using Bayesian inference. We\nnumerically illustrate these results for $D_4 \\cong \\mathbb Z_4 \\rtimes \\mathbb\nZ_2$ TO.
