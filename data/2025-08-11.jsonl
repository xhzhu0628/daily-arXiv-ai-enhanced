In contrast to existing methods, KQSE\nyields estimates of the density matrix in various bases, as well as trace\nquantities such as purity, higher moments, overlap, and trace distance, with a\nnear-optimal convergence rate of $\\tilde{O}\\bigl(T^{-1}\\bigr)$, where $T$ is\nthe total number of measurements. KQSE is robust for multimodal, non-Gaussian\nstates, making it particularly well suited for characterizing states essential\nfor quantum science."}

However,\nthe scalability of QMC is still compromised by several other bottlenecks, and\nspecifically those related to the actual evaluation of observables based on\nrandom deviates that lies at the core of the approach. Here we show how the\nset-transformer architecture can be used to dramatically accelerate or even\nbypass that step, especially for time-consuming operators such as powers of the\nmagnetization. We illustrate the procedure with a range of examples of\nincreasing complexity, from the classical Ising model to quantum systems with\nlong-range interactions, and comprising both regressions (to predict\nobservables) and classifications (to detect phase transitions). Moreover, we\nshow how transfer learning can be leveraged to reduce the training cost by\nreusing knowledge from different systems and smaller system sizes."}

On\nthe other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives\nin energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that\nnonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a\ndamped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to\nnonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness\nagainst disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for\nsteady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a\nfine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium\ncase. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition\ndriven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a\ntime-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by\nthe geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete\nsymmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple\nharmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down.\nOur predictions have important physical implications for a three-component\nspinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the\nstructural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated\nself-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation\ndespite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths."}
