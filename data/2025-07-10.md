### [1] [Extracting filtered signal statistics of continuously measured quantum systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06303)
*Anthony Kiely,Gabriel T. Landi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效计算量子系统稳态的方法，并分析了滤波信号的统计特性。

Result: 获得了滤波信号的完整统计信息，包括矩、概率分布、互信息、相关函数和Fisher信息。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子系统稳态分析提供了高效工具，并可扩展到弱反馈驱动的情况。

Abstract: The joint state of a continuously monitored quantum system and the classical
filtered measurement record has recently been shown to be described by a
quantum Fokker-Planck master equation. We present a numerically efficient
approach to compute the steady state of the system and detector in the absence
of feedback. We use this to extract detailed statistics of the filtered signal,
including all moments, the full probability distribution, the mutual
information, correlation functions, as well as the Fisher information for
parameter estimation. Building on this, we demonstrate how perturbative
corrections allow one to efficiently determine the steady state solution for
weak feedback driving.

Conclusion: Fibonacci波导是一种实验可行的多功能平台，可将非周期性结构的确定性复杂性直接引入量子发射体的相互作用中。

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for
engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic
arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a
fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose
hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic
Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack
translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy
spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate
between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve
decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two
paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest
aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon
bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the
aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself
inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly
coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this
case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles,
resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work
establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is
experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of
aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between
quantum emitters.

### [3] [Trainability of Quantum Models Beyond Known Classical Simulability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06344)
*Sabri Meyer,Francesco Scala,Francesco Tacchino,Aurelien Lucchi*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了变分量子算法（VQAs）的可训练性与计算复杂度的关系，提出了一种避免梯度消失的新方法，并揭示了其与量子优势的潜在联系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VQAs在扩展性上面临的梯度消失问题，并探讨避免这一问题是否会导致经典可模拟性，从而限制量子优势。

Conclusion: 研究为设计无梯度消失的实用变分模型提供了理论支持，并展示了实现量子优势的潜在路径。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) are promising candidates for near-term
quantum computing, yet they face scalability challenges due to barren plateaus,
where gradients vanish exponentially in the system size. Recent conjectures
suggest that avoiding barren plateaus might inherently lead to classical
simulability, thus limiting the opportunities for quantum advantage. In this
work, we advance the theoretical understanding of the relationship between the
trainability and computational complexity of VQAs, thus directly addressing the
conjecture. We introduce the Linear Clifford Encoder (LCE), a novel technique
that ensures constant-scaling gradient statistics on optimization landscape
regions that are close to Clifford circuits. Additionally, we leverage
classical Taylor surrogates to reveal computational complexity phase
transitions from polynomial to super-polynomial as the initialization region
size increases. Combining these results, we reveal a deeper link between
trainability and computational complexity, and analytically prove that barren
plateaus can be avoided in regions for which no classical surrogate is known to
exist. Furthermore, numerical experiments on LCE transformed landscapes confirm
in practice the existence of a super-polynomially complex ``transition zone''
where gradients decay polynomially. These findings indicate a plausible path to
practically relevant, barren plateau-free variational models with potential for
quantum advantage.

Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with
applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and
metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics,
quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to
be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics
to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation,
quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum
characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond
the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring
together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble
systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein
condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose-
and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.

### [5] [Density matrix analysis of systems influenced by periodic Hamiltonians](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06355)
*Soham Sen,Manjari Dutta,Sunandan Gangopadhyay*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了受时间周期性哈密顿量影响的简单系统，通过密度矩阵方法求解Liouville运动方程，验证了Lewis-Reisenfeld不变量的有效性，并分析了双能级系统的相干性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索时间周期性哈密顿量对系统状态的影响，验证密度矩阵与Lewis不变量的关系，并研究双能级系统的相干性。

Method: 采用密度矩阵方法求解Liouville运动方程，结合Lewis-Reisenfeld不变量理论，分析双能级系统的相干性。

Result: 验证了密度矩阵与Lewis不变量的等价性，计算并绘制了双能级系统的相干性随时间的变化。

Conclusion: 密度矩阵方法在分析周期性哈密顿量系统中有效，Lewis不变量与密度矩阵一致，双能级系统的相干性可通过Liouville方程量化。

Abstract: In this work, we consider simple systems that are influenced by Hamiltonians
with time periodicity. Our analysis is mainly focussed on the density matrix
approach and aims to solve the Liouville equation of motion from which one can
extract the state of the system when the system is in a pure state. We start
our analysis with the standard Rabi-oscillation problem. We consider a density
matrix corresponding to the entire model system and solve the Liouville
equation of motion. We have then made use of the Lewis-Reisenfeld invariant
approach and arrive at the exact same result which implies that the density
matrix of the system can indeed be identified with the Lewis invariant.
Finally, we consider a two-level system with a constant magnetic field in the
$z$-direction and a time dependent magnetic field in the $x$-direction.
Finally, we solve the Liouville equation of motion for this system and
calculate the various coherence measures and plot them to investigate the time
dependence and reliability of different coherence measures.

### [6] [Experimental Ground-State Energy of a 125-Site Flat Kagome Antiferromagnet via Hamiltonian Engineering on Quantum Computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06361)
*Muhammad Ahsan*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 利用IBM量子处理器计算125位点Kagome晶格的基态能量，展示了实用级量子计算的实例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Kagome晶格在反铁磁Heisenberg模型下的基态能量，以验证量子计算的实用性和可扩展性。

Method: 采用混合方法，将变分量子本征求解器（VQE）分为局部（经典）和全局（量子）部分，并引入哈密顿工程策略简化ansatz。

Result: 最佳基态能量估计为-0.417J，接近热力学值-0.438J，成功纠缠103个量子比特。

Conclusion: 展示了VQE在二维受挫系统中的可扩展性，为未来研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present an instance of utility-grade quantum computation by calculating
the ground-state energy of a 125-site flat Kagome lattice under the
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (KAFH), using IBM's Falcon and Hummingbird
quantum processors. For spin-1/2 KAFH, our best per-site ground-state energy
estimate reaches -0.417J, and after applying open-boundary corrections, it
closely approaches the established thermodynamic value of -0.438J. To achieve
this, we propose a hybrid approach that splits the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) into local (classical) and global (quantum) components for
efficient hardware utilization. We further introduce a Hamiltonian engineering
strategy that increases coupling on defect triangles to mimic loop-flip
dynamics, allowing us to simplify the ansatz while retaining physical accuracy.
Using a single-repetition, hardware-efficient ansatz, we entangle up to 103
qubits with high fidelity to determine the Hamiltonian's lowest eigenvalue.
This work demonstrates the scalability of VQE for frustrated 2D systems and
lays the foundation for future studies using deeper ansatz circuits and larger
lattices.

*R. E. Kastner*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文讨论了Danan等人的嵌套干涉仪实验，探讨了其在时间对称量子理论解释中的本体论意义，指出光子由其波函数的所有部分支持，而非选择性截断的“一阶”部分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨嵌套干涉仪实验在时间对称量子理论中的意义，澄清光子波函数的支持方式。

Method: 分析Danan等人的实验，结合时间对称量子理论解释光子的波函数行为。

Result: 指出光子由其完整波函数支持，传统截断路径的图示是错误的，且Transactional Formulation能解释实验现象。

Conclusion: Transactional Formulation能更好地解释嵌套干涉仪实验中的光子行为，支持时间对称量子理论。

Abstract: A nested interferometer experiment by Danan et al (2013) is discussed and
some ontological implications explored, primarily in the context of
time-symmetric interpretations of quantum theory. It is pointed out that
photons are supported by all components of their wavefunctions, not selectively
truncated "first order" portions of them, and that figures representing both a
gap in the photon's path and signals from the cut-off path are incorrect. It is
also noted that the Transactional Formulation (traditionally known as the
Transactional Interpretation) readily accounts for the observed phenomena.

### [8] [Controlling quantum entanglement with classical non-separable light](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06462)

Conclusion: 研究揭示了经典非分离性与量子纠缠之间的物理联系，为量子信息处理提供了新视角。

Abstract: Here we investigate the quantum frequency conversion of entangled photons
driven by a classically non-separable laser beam. We show that the frequency
conversion dynamics is described by a quantum channel that stems from the
classical drive field through the channel-state duality - the quantum channel
is dual to the classical coherence matrix of the drive field. This implies that
the evolution of entanglement in the conversion process is bound by the
classical non-separability of the drive field, a result that we confirm
experimentally. Furthermore, we show that the conversion dynamics can be
understood as a swapping operation between classical non-separability and
entanglement, unveiling a physical connection between two fundamentally
different concepts.

### [9] [Tunable cavity coupling of a single SnV$^{-}$ center in nanodiamond across bad-emitter and bad-cavity regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06553)
*Selene Sachero,Robert Berghaus,Elena Nieto Hernandez,Florian Feuchtmayr,Niklas Lettner,Patrick Maier,Sviatoslav Ditalia Tchernij,Alexander Kubanek*

Main category: quant-ph

Result: 在4K温度下，测量到Purcell因子超过1.7，证实了腔增强发射。

Conclusion: 结果表明，纳米金刚石中的SnV$^{-}$中心可作为量子网络的相干单光子源。

Abstract: Efficient coupling between quantum emitters and optical cavities is essential
for scalable quantum photonic technologies. Group IV vacancy centers in
diamond, particularly the negatively charged tin-vacancy center, have emerged
as promising candidates due to their spectral stability, high Debye-Waller
factor and large orbital splitting in ground-states. Here, we demonstrate
controlled couplinag of a single negatively charged tin vacancy center hosted
in a nanodiamond to a fully tunable Fabry-Perot microcavity. At cryogenic
temperatures, we access the weak coupling regime and observe a transition from
the bad-emitter to the bad-cavity regime as the optical transition of the color
center narrows. At 4 K, a Purcell factor exceeding 1.7 is measured, confirming
cavity-enhanced emission. The obtained results demonstrate the potential of
SnV$^{-}$ centers in nanodiamonds as a coherent single-photon source for
quantum networks.

### [10] [On the commutator scaling in Hamiltonian simulation with multi-product formulas](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06557)
*Kaoru Mizuta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 多产品公式（MPF）结合Trotter化和线性组合单元（LCU）在哈密顿模拟中高效，但现有误差边界与系统大小效率不兼容。本文提出替代误差边界，证明MPF在保持LCU的polylog(1/ε)缩放的同时，系统大小依赖与Trotter化相当。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MPF误差边界无法完全利用局部性，导致系统大小效率问题。本文旨在解决这一问题，提供更准确的误差和成本分析。

Method: 使用Floquet-Magnus展开技术，提出具有截断阶数的嵌套交换子误差边界，充分利用局部性。

Result: 证明MPF在系统大小依赖上与Trotter化相当，同时保持LCU的polylog(1/ε)缩放。

Conclusion: 本文的误差和成本分析改进了MPF的效率，适用于各种基于Trotter化插值或外推的算法。

Abstract: A multi-product formula (MPF) is a promising approach for Hamiltonian
simulation efficiently both in the system size $N$ and the inverse allowable
error $1/\varepsilon$ by combining Trotterization and the linear combination of
unitaries (LCU). It achieves poly-logarithmic cost in $1/\varepsilon$ like LCU
[G. H. Low, V. Kliuchnikov, N. Wiebe, arXiv:1907.11679 (2019)]. The efficiency
in $N$ is expected to come from the commutator scaling in Trotterization, and
this appears to be confirmed by the error bound of MPF expressed by nested
commutators [J. Aftab, D. An, K. Trivisa, arXiv:2403.08922 (2024)]. However, we
point out that the efficiency of MPF in the system size $N$ is not exactly
resolved yet in that the present error bound expressed by nested commutators is
incompatible with the size-efficient complexity reflecting the commutator
scaling. The problem is that $q$-fold nested commutators with arbitrarily large
$q$ are involved in their requirement and error bound. The benefit of
commutator scaling by locality is absent, and the cost efficient in $N$ becomes
prohibited in general. In this paper, we show an alternative commutator-scaling
error of MPF and derive its size-efficient cost properly inheriting the
advantage in Trotterization. The requirement and the error bound in our
analysis, derived by techniques from the Floquet-Magnus expansion, have a
certain truncation order in the nested commutators and can fully exploit the
locality. We prove that Hamiltonian simulation by MPF certainly achieves the
cost whose system-size dependence is as large as Trotterization while keeping
the $\mathrm{polylog}(1/\varepsilon)$-scaling like the LCU. Our results will
provide improved or accurate error and cost also for various algorithms using
interpolation or extrapolation of Trotterization.

### [11] [Quantum Error Mitigation by Global Randomized Error Cancellation for Adiabatic Evolution in the Schwinger Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06601)
*Oleg Kaikov,Theo Saporiti,Vasily Sazonov,Mohamed Tamaazousti*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 扩展了全局随机误差消除（GREC）方法，用于量子误差缓解（QEM），应用于含噪声量子设备上的绝热演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在含噪声量子设备上更有效地进行绝热演化，并探索误差缓解方法的可转移性。

Method: 采用绝热GREC方法，在模拟量子设备上测试了晶格Schwinger模型中本征态的演化。

Result: 发现GREC在不同参数区域和相态间具有可转移性，且比零噪声外推（ZNE）误差更小、计算资源更高效。

Conclusion: 绝热GREC是一种有效的QEM方法，未来可通过进一步优化减少量子计算资源需求。

Abstract: We extend the global randomized error cancellation (GREC) method for quantum
error mitigation (QEM) in an application to adiabatic evolution of states on a
noisy quantum device. We apply the adiabatic GREC method to the evolution of
eigenstates in the lattice Schwinger model on a simulated quantum device with
custom noise. Our results suggest that the corresponding QEM learned in one
parameter regime of the model successfully transfers to a different parameter
regime. In particular, our findings indicate that it transfers between
different phases of the model. We observe that adiabatic GREC produces a
smaller error than zero noise extrapolation (ZNE). Furthermore, in general,
adiabatic GREC can be more cost-efficient in terms of the total number of gates
used for the simulations. We comment on approaches to further reduce the
necessary quantum computational resources. We also outline extensions of the
introduced adiabatic GREC QEM method.

### [12] [Quantum algorithm for edge detection in digital grayscale images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06642)
*Mohit Rohida,Alok Shukla,Prakash Vedula*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于序序Walsh-Hadamard变换的新型量子边缘检测算法，显著提升了现有量子技术的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 改进现有量子边缘检测方法的效率，降低计算复杂度。

Method: 使用序序Walsh-Hadamard变换和量子高通滤波器提取图像边缘信息。

Result: 算法电路深度为O(n)，计算成本为O(log₂(N₁N₂))，优于QFT和QHED。

Conclusion: 该算法在边缘检测中表现出更高的效率和性能。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel quantum algorithm for edge detection in
digital grayscale images, based on the sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard
transform. The proposed method significantly improves upon existing quantum
techniques for edge detection by using a quantum algorithm for the
sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard transform, achieving a circuit depth of
$\mathcal{O}(n)$ (where $n$ is the number of qubits). This represents a notable
enhancement over the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which has a circuit depth
of $\mathcal{O}(n^{2})$. Furthermore, our approach for edge detection has a
computational cost (both gate complexity and quantum circuit depth) of
$\mathcal{O}(\log_{2}(N_{1}N_{2}))$ for an image of size $N_{1}\times N_{2}$,
offering a considerable improvement over the Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection
(QHED) algorithm, which incurs a cost of
$\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log_{2}(N_{1}N_{2})))$. By integrating a quantum
high-pass filter with the sequency-ordered Walsh-Hadamard transform, the
algorithm effectively extracts edge information from images. Computational
examples are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed algorithm
which provides a better performance in comparison to QHED.

### [13] [Optimized Circuit Cutting for QAOA Sampling Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06649)
*Friedrich Wagner,Christian Ufrecht,Martin Braun,Daniel D. Scherer*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 电路切割技术用于纯采样任务，通过优化切割方案减少噪声影响，提升量子优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究电路切割技术在纯采样任务中的应用，以解决大规模量子电路的噪声问题。

Method: 使用整数规划方法最小化切割次数，并在量子硬件上实验验证。

Result: 切割减少了电路尺寸和噪声影响，尽管会略微改变比特串分布，但整体效果优于未切割情况。

Conclusion: 电路切割结合优化方案可扩展问题规模并降低噪声，适用于近期量子优化。

Abstract: Circuit cutting was originally designed to retrieve the expectation value of
an observable with respect to a large quantum circuit by executing smaller
circuit fragments. In this work, however, we demonstrate the application of
circuit cutting to a pure sampling task. In particular, we sample solutions to
an optimization problem from a trained QAOA circuit. Here, circuit cutting
leads to a broadening and shift of the bitstring distribution towards
suboptimal values compared to the uncut case. To reduce this effect, we
minimize the number of required cuts via integer programming methods. On the
other hand, cutting reduces the circuit size and thus the impact of noise. Our
experiments on quantum hardware reveal that, for large circuits, the effect of
noise reduction outweighs the derogative effects on the bitstring distribution.
The study therefore provides evidence that circuit cutting combined with
optimized cutting schemes can both scale problem size and mitigate noise for
near-term quantum optimization.

### [14] [Two Variations of Quantum Phase Estimation for Reducing Circuit Error Rates: Application to the Harrow--Hassidim--Lloyd Algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06711)
*Yonghae Lee,Minjin Choi,Youngho Min,Eunok Bae,Sunghyun Bae*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了两种量子相位估计算法的变体：量子移位相位估计和量子穿孔相位估计，用于优化电路并减少错误率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通过改进量子相位估计算法，减少量子比特和门的数量，从而降低当前硬件上的电路错误率。

Method: 采用移位和穿孔技术，结合量子-经典混合实现Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd算法，优化电路。

Result: 实验证明，该方法减少了量子比特和门的数量，降低了错误率。

Conclusion: 提出的混合方法在IBM超导硬件上验证了其错误缓解效果。

Abstract: We introduce two variations of the quantum phase estimation algorithm:
quantum shifted phase estimation and quantum punctured phase estimation. The
shifted method employs a bit-string left shift to discard the most significant
bit and focus on lower-order phase components, and the punctured method removes
qubits corresponding to known phase bits, thereby streamlining the circuit. To
demonstrate the effectiveness of the two variations, we integrate them into a
hybrid quantum-classical implementation of the Harrow--Hassidim--Lloyd
algorithm for solving linear systems. The hybrid method leverages both quantum
and classical processors to identify and remove unnecessary qubits and gates.
As a result, our method reduces qubit and gate counts compared to previous
implementations, leading to lower overall circuit error rates on current
hardware. Experimental demonstrations on IBM superconducting hardware confirm
the error-mitigation effectiveness of the proposed hybrid method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 通过组合优化的案例研究验证了方法的有效性，并展示了其可推广性。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子设计自动化软件层奠定了基础，适用于更广泛的问题领域。

Abstract: Combining quantum computers with classical compute power has become a
standard means for developing algorithms that are eventually supposed to beat
any purely classical alternatives. While in-principle advantages for solution
quality or runtime are expected for many approaches, substantial challenges
remain: Non-functional properties like runtime or solution quality of many
approaches are not fully understood, and need to be explored empirically. This
makes it unclear which approach is best suited for a given problem. Accurately
predicting behaviour of quantum-classical algorithms opens possibilities for
software abstraction layers, which can automate decision-making for algorithm
selection and parametrisation. While such techniques find frequent use in
classical high-performance computing, they are still mostly absent from quantum
toolchains. We present a methodology to perform algorithm selection based on
desirable non-functional requirements. This simplifies decision-making
processes for users. Based on annotations at the source code level, our
framework traces key characteristics of quantum-classical algorithms, and uses
this information to predict the most suitable approach and its parameters for
given computational challenges and their non-functional requirements. As
combinatorial optimisation is a very extensively studied aspect of
quantum-classical systems, we perform a comprehensive case study based on
numerical simulations of algorithmic approaches to implement and validate our
ideas. We develop statistical models to quantify the influence of various
factors on non-functional properties, and establish predictions for optimal
algorithmic choices without manual effort. We argue that our methodology
generalises to problems beyond combinatorial optimisation, such as Hamiltonian
simulation, and lays a foundation for integrated software layers for quantum
design automation.

Abstract: Quantum relays are central to both quantum communication and distributed
quantum computing, enabling long-distance transmission and modular
architectures. Unlike classical repeaters, quantum repeaters preserve coherence
without amplifying quantum information, relying on entanglement swapping and
quantum error correction to overcome loss and decoherence. In this work, we
investigate the transmission of quantum information via quantum relay channels.
Our three-terminal relay model captures the trade-off between repeater-assisted
and repeaterless communication strategies. We propose a decode-forward coding
scheme and analyze both entanglement-assisted and unassisted scenarios. Our
framework allows for different entanglement topologies between the transmitter,
the relay and the destination receiver, recovering known results on
entanglement-assisted and unassisted communication. Furthermore, we discuss the
interpretation of coding with quantum side information. These findings serve as
a stepping stone for the design of secure, efficient, and reliable quantum
networks and the practical realization of quantum repeaters and long-range
quantum key distribution.

Abstract: Qutrit offers the potential for enhanced quantum computation by exploiting an
enlarged Hilbert space. However, the synthesis of high-fidelity and fast qutrit
gates, particularly for single qutrit, remains an ongoing challenge, as it
involves overcoming intrinsic constraints in quantum platforms. Here, we
develop a novel framework for the efficient implementation of a single-qutrit
gate set via coherent control, leveraging SU(3) dynamics while obviating
platform-specific constraints such as arising from the selection rule. As a
proof-of-principle demonstration, we realize 35 ns qutrit Hadamard and X gates
using a superconducting transmon, achieving an average fidelity of 99.5\%, as
verified by randomized benchmarking. We further demonstrate two paradigmatic
quantum circuits, which can be naturally extended to scalable qudit algorithms
for phase estimation and parity check. By addressing the challenge of
efficiently implementing single-qutrit gates, our protocol paves the pathway
for realizing high-performance qutrit processors in diverse quantum platforms.

Conclusion: 量子计算在水分配网络建模中具有潜力，但需进一步研究以扩展至大规模网络。

Abstract: To compute models for Water Distribution Networks (WDN), a large system of
non-linear equations needs to be solved. The hallmark algorithm for computing
these models is the Newton-Raphson Global Gradient Algorithm (NR-GGA), which
solves these systems iteratively. Even so, large networks can take multiple
days to model and the complexity of networks is only expected to increase in
the future. It is therefore important to explore different algorithms using
innovative technologies, to improve the tractability of modelling large
networks. Quantum computing is such an innovative technology that is still in
its early stages of development, paired with a different computational
paradigm. In this research we have determined the feasibility of using quantum
computing algorithms as a subroutine of NR-GGA and alternatively for replacing
NR-GGA with a quantum algorithm in its entirety. Calculations were run on
emulators of gate-based quantum computers and using simulated annealing while
models were tested on small 2-loop networks of 7 nodes. To improve NR-GGA,
three different quantum subroutines were used: the hybrid Variational Quantum
Linear Solver (VQLS) showed the best results on this small dataset. To replace
NR-GGA by a quantum algorithm in its entirety, we also used a Quantum
Annealing-based approach for simulating higher-order polynomials to determine
the Least-Cost Design (LCD) of a small 3 node network.

Abstract: Quantum imaging with undetected photons (QIUP) is a promising technique for
non-invasive imaging, particularly at wavelengths where detectors are
inefficient or unavailable. Recent studies have investigated the role of
polarization in QIUP schemes. In this work, we examine whether post-generation
optical elements can recover interference when the signal photons are
distinguishable in polarization at the source. Specifically, we employ a
Mach-Zehnder interferometer after the photon pairs are generated from two
nonlinear crystals. Our results indicate that polarization distinguishability
at the time of generation leads to a loss of interference that cannot be
restored by post-generation optical arrangements. This highlights the
fundamental importance of indistinguishability at the source for maintaining
coherence in QIUP systems.

Abstract: We consider the problem of predicting future expectation values of a
collection of quantum observables, given their noisy expectation values at past
times. The measured observables, the initial state of the physical system and
even the Hilbert space are unknown; we nonetheless assume a promise on the
energy distribution of the state. Investigating to what extent extrapolation is
possible in this framework, we discover highly problematic datasets that allow
full predictability at any future time $\tau$, but only when past averages are
known up to precision superexponential in $\tau$. We also find families of
"self-testing datasets", which allow practical predictability under reasonable
noise levels and whose approximate realization singles out specific
Hamiltonians, states and measurement operators. We identify "aha! datasets",
which drastically increase the predictability of the future statistics of an
unrelated measurement, as well as "fog banks": fairly simple datasets that
exhibit complete unpredictability at some future time $\tau$, but full
predictability for a later time $\tau'>\tau$. Finally, we prove that the
extrapolation problem is efficiently solvable up to arbitrary precision through
hierarchies of semidefinite programming relaxations.

Abstract: Bayesian inference is a widely used technique for real-time characterization
of quantum systems. It excels in experimental characterization in the low data
regime, and when the measurements have degrees of freedom. A decisive factor
for its performance is the numerical representation of the Bayesian probability
distributions. In this work, we explore advanced statistical methods for this
purpose, and numerically analyze their performance against the state-of-the-art
in quantum parameter learning. In particular, we consider sequential importance
resampling, tempered likelihood estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, random
walk Metropolis (RWM), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variants (stochastic
gradients with and without friction, energy conserving subsampling), block
pseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings with subsampling, hybrid HMC-RWM
approaches, and Gaussian rejection filtering. We demonstrate advantages of
these approaches over existing ones, namely robustness under multi-modality and
high dimensionality. We apply these algorithms to the calibration of
superconducting qubits from IBMQ, surpassing the standard quantum limit and
achieving better results than Qiskit's default tools. In Hahn echo and Ramsey
experiments, we reduce the uncertainty by factors of 10 and 3 respectively,
without increasing the number of measurements; conversely, we match the
performance of Qiskit's methods while using up to to 99.5% less experimental
data. We additionally investigate the roles of adaptivity, dataset ordering and
heuristics in quantum characterization. Our findings have applications in
challenging quantum characterization tasks, namely learning the dynamics of
open quantum systems.

Abstract: Spontaneous collapse models provide a possible, testable solution to the
quantum measurement problem. While experiments are providing increasingly
stronger bounds on their parameters, a full-fledged relativistic extension is
still missing. Previous attempts have encoutered different obstacles, such as
violation of microcausality, infinite energy rate, and particle production from
vacuum. Here, we propose generalization of the collapse master equation that is
characterized by a local field collapse operator and a non-Markovian noise with
a Lorentz invariant correlation. Our construction is able to overcome
previously encountered problems and has the desirable properties in the non
relativistic limit. A specific choice of the noise correlation function is also
introduced and discussed.

Abstract: Qubit readout and reset are critical components for the practical realization
of quantum computing systems, as outlined by the DiVincenzo criteria. Here, we
present a scalable architecture employing frequency-tunable nonlinear Purcell
filters designed specifically for superconducting qubits. This architecture
enables flexible readout and unconditional reset functionalities. Our readout
protocol dynamically adjusts the effective linewidth of the readout resonator
through a tunable filter, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio during
measurement while suppressing photon noise during idle periods. Achieving a
readout fidelity of $99.3\%$ without using Josephson parametric amplifiers or
traveling-wave parametric amplifiers, even with a small dispersive shift,
demonstrates its effectiveness. For reset operations, our protocol utilizes the
tunable coupler adjacent to the target qubit as an intermediary to channel
qubit excitations into the Purcell filter, enabling rapid dissipation. We
demonstrate unconditional reset of both leakage-induced $|2\rangle$ and
$|1\rangle$ states within 200 ns (error rate $\leq1\%$), and reset of the
$|1\rangle$ state alone in just 75 ns. Repeated reset cycles ($\leq600$ ns)
further reduce the error rate below $0.1\%$. Furthermore, the filter suppresses
both photon noise and the Purcell effect, thereby reducing qubit decoherence.
This scalable Purcell filter architecture shows exceptional performance in
qubit readout, reset, and protection, marking it as a promising hardware
component for advancing fault-tolerant quantum computing systems.

Conclusion: 该方法可作为识别支持边界时间晶体相的新耗散集体自旋模型的工具，且在某些情况下该相在增加耗散时仍稳定。

Abstract: Boundary time crystals have been extensively studied through numerical and
mean-field methods. However, a comprehensive analytical approach in terms of
the Liouvillian eigenvalues, without semiclassical approximations, has yet to
be developed. In this work, we analyse the Liouvillian spectrum of dissipative
spin models, within a perturbative framework in the weak-dissipation limit.
Introducing the superspin method, we compute the eigenvalues to first order in
perturbation theory, providing a direct and transparent explanation for the
emergence of the time crystal phase. We analytically demonstrate how
spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to persistent oscillations. Our
method can be used as a tool to unequivocally identify new dissipative
collective spin models that support a boundary time crystal phase. We
demonstrate this by applying the technique to four distinct, collective spin
Liouvillians, which experience some dissipation. The first of these is the
paradigmatic model studied in [1]. We demonstrate how the boundary time crystal
phase is a general feature of models that yield a solution solely in terms of a
quantity that we term the superspin. Furthermore, we analyse the stability of
this phase and demonstrate how, in some cases, it is stable against increasing
dissipation.

provides a trade-off between the number of CNOT gates (and consequently, the

Motivation: 探索量子核与量子神经形态方法在机器学习任务中的性能差异，特别是在不同维度数据集上的表现。

Method: pQK通过角度编码和参数优化生成核矩阵，QLIF使用脉冲序列和时序距离度量。两者均用于经典谱聚类流程。

Conclusion: 量子核方法在高维数据中可能更具潜力，而量子神经形态方法在低维任务中表现更优。

Abstract: We compare a parameterized quantum kernel (pQK) with a quantum leaky
integrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuromorphic computing approach that employs either
the Victor-Purpura or van Rossum kernel in a spectral clustering task, as well
as the classical radial basis function (RBF) kernel. Performance evaluation
includes label-based classification and clustering metrics, as well as optimal
number of clusters predictions for each dataset based on an elbow-like curve as
is typically used in $K$-means clustering. The pQK encodes feature vectors
through angle encoding with rotation angles scaled parametrically. Parameters
are optimized through grid search to maximize kernel-target alignment,
producing a kernel that reflects distances in the feature space. The quantum
neuromorphic approach uses population coding to transform data into spike
trains, which are then processed using temporal distance metrics. Kernel
matrices are used as input into a classical spectral clustering pipeline prior
to performance evaluation. For the synthetic datasets and \texttt{Iris}, the
QLIF kernel typically achieves better classification and clustering performance
than pQK. However, on higher-dimensional datasets, such as a preprocessed
version of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (\texttt{SDSS}), pQK performed better,
indicating a possible advantage in higher-dimensional regimes.

Abstract: Defining suitable quantum extensions of classical divergences often poses a
challenge due to the non-commutative nature of quantum information. In this
work, we propose a new approach via what we call the layer cake representation.
The resulting quantum R\'enyi and $f$-divergences are then proven to be
equivalent to those recently defined via integral representations.
Nevertheless, the approach can provide several insights. We give an alternative
proof of the integral representation of the relative entropy by Frenkel and
prove a conjecture regarding a trace expression for the R\'enyi divergence.
Additionally, we give applications to error exponents in hypothesis testing, a
new Riemann-Stieltjes type integral representation and a variational
representation.

Abstract: Quantum emitters promise to emit exactly one photon with high probability
when pumped by a laser pulse. However, even in ideal systems, re-excitation
during a laser pulse causes the consecutive emission of two photons, thus
limiting the single-photon purity. Although the probability and properties of
re-excitation are largely determined by the optical excitation method, until
now only resonant driving has been studied. Here, we demonstrate qualitative
differences in the process arising from phonon-assisted excitation -- a scheme
standing out for its robustness and straightforward spectral suppression of
scattered laser light while preserving highly indistinguishable emission. In
contrast to previous studies under resonant driving, we measure not only the
$g^{(2)}(0)$ as a function of pulse length but also resolve the distinct
temporal and spectral shape of each of the photons, report an asymmetric
two-photon spectrum and uncover correlations between the emission time and
wavelength, which are unique to phonon-assisted pumping. On the fundamental
side, we show how the spectrum stemming from re-excitation provides direct
access to the Rabi frequency of an incoherently driven quantum dot. On the
application side, we use the asymmetric spectral response to selectively
suppress multiphoton noise from re-excitation, ensuring a high-single photon
purity regardless of the laser pulse length and thus enhancing implementations
across quantum cryptography and quantum computing.

Abstract: The open quantum Rabi model describes a two-level system coupled to a
harmonic oscillator. A Gaussian phase transition for the nonequilibrium steady
states has been predicted when the bosonic mode is soft and subject to damping.
We show that oscillator dephasing is a relevant perturbation, which leads to a
non-Gaussian phase transition and an intriguing cascade of instabilities for
$k$-th order bosonic operators. For the soft-mode limit, the equations of
motion form a closed hierarchy and spectral properties can be efficiently
studied. To this purpose, we establish a fruitful connection to non-Hermitian
Hamiltonians. The results for the phase diagram, stability boundaries, and
relevant observables are based on mean-field analysis, exact diagonalization,
perturbation theory, and Keldysh field theory.
