One can opt for linearization frameworks such as Carleman linearization, which provides a high dimensional infinite linear system corresponding to a finite nonlinear system, as an indirect way of solving nonlinear systems using current quantum computers. We provide an efficient data access model to load this infinite linear representation of the nonlinear system, upto truncation order $N$, on a quantum computer by decomposing the Hamiltonian into the weighted sum of non-unitary operators, namely the Sigma basis. We have shown that the Sigma basis provides an exponential reduction in the number of decomposition terms compared to the traditional decomposition, which is usually done in a linear combination of Pauli operators. Once the Hamiltonian is decomposed, we then use the concept of unitary completion to construct the circuit for the implementation of each weighted tensor product component $\\mathcal{H}_{j}$ of the decomposition."}

This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries."}

Employing bit error probability (BEP) and channel capacity as quantitative performance metrics, we compare the capabilities of ensembles of quantum sensors - both unentangled and entangled - using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) as a representative example of phase modulation. We identify conditions when the channel capacity of an ensemble of quantum sensors may surpass the limits of a classical electrically small antenna. Additionally, we discuss modifications to the quantum protocol that enables high-fidelity data recovery even in the presence of sensor noise and channel distortions. Finally, we explore practical performance limits of such a quantum receive chain, with a focus on NV-diamond as the quantum sensor platform."}

For AKLT states on Bethe lattices and their decorated versions we show that there exists a deterministic, constant-time scheme for their preparation. In addition to randomly decorated AKLT states, we also consider random-bond AKLT states, whose construction involves any of the canonical Bell states in the bond degrees of freedom instead of just the singlet in the original construction. Such states naturally emerge upon measuring all the decorative spin-1 sites in the randomly decorated AKLT states. We show that those random-bond AKLT states on trivalent lattices can be converted to encoded random graph states after acting with the same POVM on all sites.

These states constitute full continuous spectra in the 1D and 2D cases alike. In 1D, these are spatially even and odd eigenstates. The 2D states may carry any value of the vorticity (alias magnetic quantum number). Asymptotic approximations for wave functions of the 1D and 2D eigenstates, valid far from the center, are derived analytically, demonstrating excellent agreement with numerically found counterparts. Special exact solutions for vortex states are obtained in the 2D case. These findings suggest an extension of the concept of bound states in the continuum, in quantum mechanics and paraxial photonics. Gross-Pitaevskii equations are considered as the nonlinear extension of the 1D and 2D settings. In 1D, the cubic nonlinearity slightly deforms the eigenstates, maintaining their stability.

The present work challenges these claims, as well as subsequent attempts to salvage the original interpretation of the ABL rule. Taking a broader view, this paper identifies a subtle category error at the heart of the ABL rule that consists of confusing observables that belong to a single system with emergent observables that arise only for physical ensembles. Along the way, this paper points out other problems and fallacious reasoning in the research literature surrounding the ABL rule, including the misuse of post-selection, a reliance on pattern matching to classical formulas, and a posture of measurementism that takes experimental data as providing answers to interpretational questions."}

It is shown that the coherence persists for longer time scales for large coupling values and shows non-monotonic behaviour reflecting the presence of non-Markovianity in the dynamics. Non-Markovianity, characterized by coherence revivals and non-monotonic decay patterns, emerges distinctly depending on the bath spectrum and coupling strengths.

This essential characteristic is utilized for detecting weak nonlinearities in both the cavity and magnonic modes, with both demonstrating similar high levels of sensitivity.

We investigate a quantum-classical approach based on the Recursive Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (RQAOA), which interleaves shallow QAOA layers with variable elimination guided by measured single- and two-qubit correlators. For interference-aware channel assignment, we give a compact QUBO/Ising formulation in which pairwise interference induces same-channel couplings and one-hot constraints are enforced via quadratic penalties (or, optionally, constraint-preserving mixers). Within RQAOA, fixing high-confidence variables or relations reduces the problem dimension, stabilizes training, and concentrates measurement effort on a shrinking instance that is solved exactly once below a cutoff. On simulated instances of modest size, including a four-user, four-channel example, the method consistently returns feasible assignments and, for the demonstrated case, attains the global optimum. These results indicate that recursion can mitigate parameter growth and feasibility issues that affect plain QAOA, and suggest a viable pathway for near-term quantum heuristics in wireless resource allocation."}

In this work, we present a comprehensive longitudinal characterization of 27 frequency-tunable transmon qubits spanning over one year across four thermal cycles. Our results establish a distinct hierarchy of stability for superconducting hardware. We find that the intrinsic device parameters determining the qubit frequency and the baseline energy relaxation times ($T_1$) exhibit high robustness against thermal stress, characterized by frequency deviations typically confined within 0.5\\% and non-degraded coherence baselines. In stark contrast, the environmental variables, specifically the background magnetic flux offsets and the microscopic landscape of two-level system (TLS) defects, undergo a significant stochastic reconfiguration after each cycle. By employing frequency-dependent relaxation spectroscopy and a quantitative metric, the $T_1$ Spectral Topography Fidelity, we demonstrate that thermal cycling acts as a ``hard reset'' for the local defect environment. This process introduces a level of spectral randomization equivalent to thousands of hours of continuous low-temperature evolution. These findings confirm that while the fabrication quality is preserved, the specific noise realization is statistically distinct for each thermal cycle, necessitating automated recalibration strategies for large-scale quantum systems."}

However, achieving this goal is currently hindered by the stringent requirement for an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor ($Q_c$). Here, we propose a dual-channel cooling scheme based on squeezing-enhanced quantum interference within a hybrid levitated cavity-magnomechanical system to overcome this limitation.\n  By synergizing squeezing effects with quantum interference between the magnon-CM and cavity-CM channels, our scheme simultaneously suppresses Stokes (heating) scattering while enhancing anti-Stokes (cooling) scattering.~We demonstrate that this cooling mechanism reduces the critical $Q_c$ required for ground-state cooling by three orders of magnitude, making it achievable in the experimentally accessible regime of $Q_c \\sim 10^4$. Furthermore, the net cooling rate is enhanced by nearly 180-fold compared to that of conventional single-channel cooling. This improvement is accompanied by a two orders of magnitude reduction in both the steady-state CM occupancy and the cooling time. Importantly, this enhanced performance remains robust even deep within the unresolved-sideband regime. Our results provide a feasible path toward preparing macroscopic quantum states by actively controlling the cooling dynamics, thereby relaxing the constraints on intrinsic material properties."}

They have demonstrated notable improvements in thresholds and scaling in surface and Floquet code memories. In this work, we use erasure qubits on Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes from the quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) regime. Owing to their sparse structure and favorable rate-distance trade-offs, BB codes are practical candidates for QEC. We introduce BiBiEQ, a novel framework that compiles a given BB code into an erasure-aware memory circuit C_E. This erasure circuit C_E comprises erasure checks (ECs), resets, and erasures spread over a user-specified erasure check schedule (2EC, 4EC). BiBiEQ converts this erasure circuit C_E into the stabilizer circuit C for general-purpose decoding. BiBiEQ provides two engines for this conversion, BiBiEQ-Exact and BiBiEQ-Approx. BiBiEQ-Exact preserves the joint-erasure correlations and serves as our accuracy benchmark, while BiBiEQ-Approx uses an independence approximation to accelerate large sweeps and expose accuracy-throughput trade-offs. Using BiBiEQ, we decode the stabilizer circuits to get a per-round logical error rate (LER) for the BB codes and quantify the effect of the EC schedules on the correctable operating region below the pseudo-threshold. The 4EC schedule keeps the accuracy of both engines close to one another, making BiBiEQ-Approx a reliable proxy for BiBiEQ-Exact for faster sweeps. Below the pseudo-threshold, the code distance (d) hop from distance (d) 6 to 10 yields a drop in LER by 10-17x larger than distance (d) 10 to 12, showing that most gains are realized by d=10."}

The strength of both correlations is governed solely by the squeezing parameter and is independent of the coherent amplitude. We further examine the impact of inevitable optical losses in various channel configurations. The results show that while losses degrade correlations, EPR steering remains monogamous and exhibits stricter resilience thresholds than entanglement. Our analysis, supported by parameter extension techniques, confirms that the steering condition is more stringent than the inseparability criterion, clearly demonstrating that steering forms a strict subset of entanglement.

We here study the geometric criticality associated with these eigenstates. The amplitude and phase of the drive serve as the control parameter of the governing Hamiltonian.

By explicitly incorporating the full set of structural constraints inherent to Choi states, our approach exploits the Choi-Jamiołkowski isomorphism for rigorous certification of quantum channels. The entanglement dimensionality of quantum channels is first certified by introducing a witness and numerically determining its Schmidt-number-dependent bounds. This certification method reproduces known analytical benchmarks and is applied to dephasing and depolarizing noise channels, thereby confirming its validity. To provide a more complete assessment of channel performance, the entanglement fidelity of quantum channels is also certified using a hierarchy of semidefinite programming relaxations based on localizing matrices. Lower bounds on the entanglement fidelity are obtained that are compatible with either the full set of observed statistics or a single witness value."}

In this work, we introduce and classify minimal nonintegrable spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians, defined as models that saturate injectivity while admitting no nontrivial local conserved charges beyond the Hamiltonian. We first rigorously establish the nonintegrability of the deformed Fredkin spin chain with periodic boundary conditions by mapping it to a nearest-neighbor composite-spin representation and excluding all admissible $3$-local conserved charges. Guided by its structure, we then construct five classes of spin-$1/2$ models with genuine three-site interactions.

This effect should be described by a Lindblad-like evolution governed by the non-trivial Hopf algebra structure of the time-evolution generators. In this work we provide a detailed analysis of such possibility for similar Hopf algebra deformations of the Hamiltonian of a qubit. Starting from a critical examination of the very definition of time evolution through the generalized adjoint action, we explore whether a coherent and physically viable framework can be established. In particular, our analysis shows that a more general combination of adjoint actions always guarantees a von Neumann dynamics and, also in the case of deformed spacetime symmetries considered in the literature, a physically viable Lindblad evolution cannot be established."}

The resulting wave function is also proposed using the trial state in phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) to recover dynamical correlations across the full orbital space (DOCI-QSCI-AFQMC). We evaluate the proposed methods on the H6 chain, N2 dissociation, and the addition of singlet O2 to a BODIPY dye.

The method employs a sequency-ordered Quantum Walsh-Hadamard Transform (QWHT), a comparator-based oracle that coherently marks basis states within an arbitrary sequency range, and Quantum Amplitude Estimation (QAE) to estimate the total probability mass in the selected band. This enables the detection of structured signal components, including both high- and low-sequency features, as well as the identification of rapid sign-change behavior associated with noise or anomalies. The proposed method can be embedded as a module within a larger quantum algorithm; in this setting, both the input and output remain fully quantum, enabling seamless integration with upstream and downstream quantum operations. We show that the sequency-ordered QWHT can be implemented with circuit depth $O(\\log_2 N)$ (equivalently $O(n)$ for $N=2^n$) when acting on an amplitude-encoded quantum state, whereas computing the full Walsh-Hadamard spectrum of an explicit length-$N$ classical signal requires $O(N\\log_2 N)$ operations via the fast Walsh-Hadamard transform. This results in an exponential quantum advantage when the QWHT is used as a modular block within a larger quantum algorithm, relative to classical fast Walsh-Hadamard transform-based approaches operating on explicit data. From an application perspective, the proposed sequency band-energy estimation may be interpreted as a structure-based anomaly indicator, enabling the detection of unexpected high-sequency components relative to a nominal low-sequency signal class.

Comments are welcome!", "summary": "Linear optical quantum computation (LOQC) offers a promising platform for scalable quantum information processing, but its scalability is fundamentally constrained by the probabilistic nature of non-local entangling gates. Qudit circuit compression schemes mitigate this issue by encoding multiple qubits onto qudits. However, these schemes become inefficient when only a subset of the encoded qubits is required to participate in the non-local entangling gate, leading to an exponential increase in the number of non-local gates. In this Letter, we address this bottleneck by demonstrating the existence of multi-level control-Z (CZ) gates for qudits encoded in multiple spatial modes in LOQC. Unlike conventional two-level CZ gates, which act only on a single pair of modes, multi-level CZ gates impart a conditional phase shift for an arbitrarily chosen subset of the spatial modes. We present two explicit linear optical schemes that realize such operations, illustrating a fundamental trade-off between prior information about the input quantum state and the physical resources required. The first scheme is realized with a constant success probability of $1/8$ independent of the qudit dimension using a single non-local entangling gate, at the cost of state dependence, which is significantly better than the current success probability of $1/9$. Our second scheme provides a fully state independent realization reducing the number of non-local gates to $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1}+2^{r_2})$ as compared to the existing bound of $\\mathcal{O}(2^{r_1+r_2})$ where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the number of qubits to be removed as control in the qudits.

Recent experimental advances have enabled the tailoring of noise properties through Pauli twirling, transforming arbitrary noise channels into Pauli channels. This underpins theoretical descriptions of fault-tolerant quantum computation and forms an essential tool in noise characterization and error mitigation. Pauli-Lindblad channels have been introduced to aptly parameterize quasi-local Pauli errors across a quantum register, excluding negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters relying on the Markovianity of the underlying noise processes. We point out that caution is required when parameterizing channels as Pauli-Lindblad channels with nonnegative parameters. For this, we study the effects of Pauli twirling on Markovianity. We use the notion of Markovianity of a channel (rather than that of an entire semigroup) and prove a general Pauli channel is non-Markovian if and only if at least one of its Pauli-Lindblad parameters is negative. Using this, we show that Markovian quantum channels often become non-Markovian after Pauli twirling. The Pauli-twirling induced non-Markovianity necessitates the use of negative Pauli-Lindblad parameters for a correct noise description in experimentally realistic scenarios. An important example is the implementation of the $\\sqrt{X}$-gate under standard Markovian noise. As such, our results have direct implications for quantum error mitigation protocols that rely on accurate noise characterization."}

Moreover, it provides a systematic way to construct Bell inequalities that are tailored to specific quantum information processing tasks. This characterisation is well understood in the simplest $(2,2,2)$ scenario, namely two parties performing two binary outcome measurements.

Deterministic entanglement distribution over long distances is a prerequisite for scalable quantum networks, enabling the utilization of device-independent quantum key distribution (DI-QKD) and quantum teleportation to achieve secure and efficient information transfer. However, the exponential photon loss in optical fibres prohibits efficient and deterministic entanglement distribution. Quantum repeaters, incorporating entanglement swapping and entanglement purification with quantum memories, offer the most promising means to overcome this limitation in fibre-based quantum networks. Despite numerous pioneering efforts toward realizing quantum repeaters, a critical bottleneck remains, as remote memory-memory entanglement suffers from decoherence more rapidly than it can be established and purified over long distances. We overcome this by developing long-lived trapped-ion memories, an efficient telecom interface, and a high-visibility single-photon entanglement protocol. This allows us to establish and maintain memory-memory entanglement over a 10 km fibre within the average entanglement establishment time for the same distance. As a direct application, we demonstrate metropolitan-scale DI-QKD, distilling 1,917 secret keys out of 4.05*10^5 Bell pairs over 10 km. We further report a positive key rate over 101 km in the asymptotic limit, extending the achievable distance by more than two orders of magnitude. Our work provides a critical building block for quantum repeaters and marks an important step toward scalable quantum networks."}

In the context of supervised learning, most of the works that tackle classification problems with parameterized quantum circuits constrain their scope to the setting of binary classification or perform multiclass classification via ensembles of binary classifiers (strategies such as one versus rest). Those few works that propose native multiclass models, however, do not justify the choice of observables that perform the classification. This work studies two main classification criteria in multiclass quantum machine learning: maximizing the expected value of an observable representing a class or maximizing the fidelity of the encoded quantum state with a reference state representing a class. To compare both approaches, sets of Pauli strings and sets of projectors into the computational basis are chosen as observables in the quantum machine learning models. Observing the empirical behavior of each model type, the effect of different observable set choices on the performance of quantum machine learning models is analyzed in the context of Barren Plateaus and Neural Collapse. The results provide insights that may guide the design of future multiclass quantum machine learning models."}

The protocol employs excitation-preserving partial-SWAP collisions between two disjoint qubit registers, mediated by $m$ ancillary ``shuttle'' qubits, and poses Dicke-state preparation as a \\emph{closed-loop design} problem: given the target $(n,m)$, automatically infer collision strengths that maximize fidelity under practical constraints. Concretely, we formulate a two-parameter, bound-constrained optimization over intra-register and shuttle--register collision angles and solve it using a multi-start strategy with L-BFGS-B, yielding a reproducible controller prescription (optimized $γ_{\\mathrm{in}}$, $γ_{\\mathrm{sh}}$, and minimal-round convergence points) for each target. This removes the need for projective measurements and extends collisional entanglement generation beyond the single-excitation (W-state) sector to arbitrary $m$.

The main proposition of PI is to minimise variationally a loss function, formally ensuring that a neural surrogate of the solution has the DE locally satisfied. The nature of such formulation encouraged the exploration of equivalent quantum algorithms, where the surrogate solution is expressed by variational quantum architectures. The locality of typical loss functions emphasises the DE to hold at an ensemble of points sampled in the domain, but encounters issues when generalising beyond such points, or when propagating boundary conditions. Issues which affect classical and quantum PI algorithms alike. The quest to fill this gap in robustness and accuracy against mainstream DE solvers has led to a plethora of proposals in various directions. In particular, classical DE solvers have long employed the weak form - an integral based approach aiming at imposing a global condition on the solution - prioritising a good average behaviour instead of ``overfitting'' select points. Here, we propose and explore to combine contributions from both local and global loss functions in PI routines, to exploit the advantages and mitigate the weaknesses of both. We showcase this intuition in a variety of problems focusing on differentiable quantum architectures, and demonstrating in particular how orchestrating such hybrid loss formulation with domain decomposition can offer a strong advantage over local-only strategies."}

However, understanding its consequences in strongly interacting systems is still elusive due to the interplay between non-perturbative strong correlations and non-Hermiticity. While the Wilsonian renormalization group (RG) method has been applied to tackle this problem, its foundation, based on the existence of the partition function, is ill-defined. In this paper, we establish a microscopic foundation of the non-Hermitian RG method from a few-body perspective. We show that the invariance of the scattering amplitude under RG transformations enables us to rigorously derive the non-Hermitian RG equation, giving a physically transparent interpretation of RG flows. We discuss a detailed structure of such RG flows in a non-relativistic two-body system with inelastic two-body loss, and show its relation to a non-Hermitian quantum scale anomaly. Our analysis suggests that non-Hermitian complex potentials often used in high-energy physics can be interpreted as being caused by quantum measurement, where the detection of elastically scattered particles updates the observer's knowledge, resulting in a nonunitary state change of the system. We apply our formalism to nuclear physics, find the emergence of a critical semicircle, and show that several nuclei are located near the critical semicircle in the coherent neutron-nucleus scattering. We also propose that the localized dineutron in two-neutron halo nuclei can be interpreted as the quantum measurement effect on the imaginary potential associated with absorption into the core nucleus.

By leveraging the photo-excited triplet state of pentacene at room temperature, we demonstrate coherent spin manipulation via acoustic driving under zero externally applied magnetic field. The heterogeneously integrated device, referred to as HODSAR, utilizes spin-phonon coupling to achieve mechanically driven, zero-field spin resonance, opening avenues for room-temperature mechanically addressable spin control and device integration.

Moreover, the repeated scheme enables higher spin-photon encoding efficiency by using a spectral-width-scaling photon pulse with a shorter duration. We show that, for realistic imperfections and losses, this repeated phase-encoding approach produces high-fidelity entangled states with an appreciable success probability even at cooperativity $C\\sim1$.

In this work, we present a novel hybrid simulation approach, forming a hybrid of a fullstate and a Clifford simulator, specifically designed to address the computational challenges associated with the time evolution of quantum chemistry Hamiltonians. Our method focuses on the efficient emulation of multi-qubit rotations, a critical component of Trotterized Hamiltonian evolution. By optimizing the representation and execution of multi-qubit operations leveraging the Pauli frame, our approach significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating quantum circuits, enabling more efficient simulations. Beyond its impact on chemistry applications, our emulation strategy has broad implications for any computational workload that relies heavily on multi-qubit rotations. By increasing the efficiency of quantum simulations, our method facilitates more accurate and cost-effective studies of complex quantum systems. We quantify the performance improvements and computational savings for this emulation strategy, and we obtain a speedup of a factor $\\approx 18$ ($\\approx 22$ with MPI) for our evaluated chemistry Hamiltonians with 24 qubits. Thus, we evaluate our integration of this emulation strategy into the Intel Quantum SDK, further bridging the gap between theoretical algorithm development and practical quantum software implementations."}
