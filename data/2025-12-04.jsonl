While Shapley value-based methods offer mathematically principled explanations by quantifying each component's contribution to predictions, computing exact values requires evaluating $2^n$ coalitions (or aggregating over $n!$ permutations), which is intractable for real-world graphs. Existing approximation strategies sacrifice either fidelity or efficiency, limiting their practical utility. We introduce QGShap, a quantum computing approach that leverages amplitude amplification to achieve quadratic speedups in coalition evaluation while maintaining exact Shapley computation. Unlike classical sampling or surrogate methods, our approach provides fully faithful explanations without approximation trade-offs for tractable graph sizes. We conduct empirical evaluations on synthetic graph datasets, demonstrating that QGShap achieves consistently high fidelity and explanation accuracy, matching or exceeding the performance of classical methods across all evaluation metrics. These results collectively demonstrate that QGShap not only preserves exact Shapley faithfulness but also delivers interpretable, stable, and structurally consistent explanations that align with the underlying graph reasoning of GNNs.

Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a potentially optimal way forward: a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They consist of arrays of interconnected photo-magnonic cavities. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics."}

We explore a wide parameter space of coupling strengths, system sizes, annealing times, and D-wave hardware architectures. We find that the naively assumed scaling law for the effective temperature requires a non-negligible, coupling-independent offset that is robust across machines and parameter regimes, quantifying residual non-thermal effects that still conform to an effective Gibbs description. These non-idealities are further reflected in a systematic discrepancy between the physical temperature inferred from the sampled ensemble and the nominal cryogenic temperature of the device. Our results systematically assess the viability of quantum annealers as experimental platforms for probing classical thermodynamics, correct previous assumptions, and provide a physically grounded thermometry framework to benchmark these machines for future thermodynamic experiments."}

We present a characterization algorithm for in situ learning of pulse trajectories by extending the Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) framework to analyze time-dependent pulses. By combining QSP with a logical-level analog-digital mapping paradigm, our method reconstructs a smooth pulse directly from queries of the time-ordered propagator, without requiring mid-circuit measurements or additional evolution. Unlike conventional Trotterization-based methods, our approach avoids unscalable performance degradation arising from accumulated local truncation errors as the logical-level segmentation increases. Through rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that our method achieves high accuracy with strong efficiency and robustness against SPAM as well as depolarizing errors, providing a lightweight and optimal validation protocol for analog quantum simulators capable of detecting major hardware faults."}

Yet, this method appears to be energetically cost-free and thus continually challenges the task of quantifying the amount of energy it demands to be accomplished. This paper proposes that the energy cost of controlling a closed quantum system using the counterdiabatic method can also be assessed using the instantaneous excess work during the process and related quantities, as the time-averaged excess work. Starting from the Mandelstam-Tamm bound for driven dynamics, we have shown that the speed-up of counterdiabatic driving is linked with the spreading of energy between the eigenstates of the total Hamiltonian, which is necessarily accompanied by transitions between these eigenstates. Nonetheless, although excess work can be used to quantify energetically these transitions, it is well known that the excess work is zero throughout the entire process under counterdiabatic driving. To recover the excess work as an energetic cost quantifier for counterdiabatic driving, we will propose a different interpretation of the parameters of the counterdiabatic Hamiltonian, leading to an excess work different from zero. We have illustrated our findings with the Landau-Zener model."}

The density matrix of the ground truth state admits a tensor train ansatz as a result of the MPS assumption, and we estimate the tensor components of the ansatz through a series of observable estimations, thus outputting an approximation of the density matrix. The procedure is provably convergent with a sample complexity that scales quadratically in the system size. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that the procedure outputs an accurate approximation to the quantum state. For observable estimation tasks involving moderately large subsystems, we show that our procedure gives rise to a more accurate estimation than the classical shadow protocol.

While Josephson-junction-based amplifiers have become standard in superconducting quantum circuits, their magnetic sensitivity, limited saturation power, and sub-kelvin operating requirements motivate the development of alternative nonlinear platforms. Here we demonstrate a two-mode kinetic-inductance parametric amplifier based on a pair of capacitively coupled Kerr-nonlinear resonators fabricated from NbTiN and NbN thin films. The distributed Kerr nonlinearity of these materials enables nondegenerate four-wave-mixing amplification with gains approaching 40 dB, gain-bandwidth products up to 6.9 MHz, and 1-dB compression powers two to three orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the-art Josephson amplifiers. A coupled-mode theoretical model accurately captures the pump-induced modification of the hybridized modes and quantitatively reproduces the observed signal and idler responses. The NbN device exhibits a significantly larger Kerr coefficient and superior gain-bandwidth performance, highlighting the advantages of high-kinetic-inductance materials.

To quantify the degree of linearity, we analyze the propagation fidelities of Gaussian wave packets in these waveguides. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such coupled-resonator waveguides can serve as versatile platforms for enabling directional atomic radiation and absorption. Beyond linear dispersion relations, more general forms, including quadratic and cubic relations, can also be achieved through tailored JNN-hoppings.

These keys enable lightweight encryption and decryption while preserving confidentiality and control accuracy. We develop a novel encryption-decryption architecture for state-feedback control of linear systems based on quantum keys, and characterize the impact of quantum state errors on closed-loop stability. In particular, we establish the existence of a critical threshold on intrinsic quantum noise below which stability is guaranteed. In contrast to classical encrypted control schemes, which may collapse under a single key-bit error, the proposed quantum encrypted control exhibits strong robustness to key imperfections. We further adopt quantization techniques to address the scenarios with limited communication bits in practical situations, and implement privacy protection for quantum keys based on a stochastic quantizer. These results demonstrate that integrating quantum technologies into control systems in a nontrivial and principled manner, even at their current level of maturity, can yield substantial performance gains in reducing computational complexity and improving resilience to key errors while ensuring security against multiple eavesdropping sources."}

A sign-resolved decomposition separates the total negative weight from its phase-space distribution and defines a negative-channel Fisher information that quantifies how sensitively the negative lobe reshapes as a control parameter is varied. This structure yields a Cauchy--Schwarz bound that limits how rapidly the imaginary entropy, and hence the Wigner negativity, can change with the parameter. In the oval billiard, avoided crossings display enhanced negativity and an amplified negative-channel Fisher response, providing a clear phase-space signature of mode hybridization.

Each input message is mapped to a weighted graph via a discrete random walk on an n X n toroidal grid, where the walk dynamics determine the edge weights. Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is then used to extract the phase spectrum of the graph Laplacian. Unlike standard QPE settings, the phase estimation is performed with respect to a superposition state (a uniform superposition over all node basis states) rather than an eigenvector, ensuring that all eigencomponents contribute to the resulting spectrum. This yields spectral features that distinguish even co-spectral but non-isomorphic message-induced graphs. The final spectral fingerprint is converted into a 256-bit digest, producing a compact representation of the input. As the fingerprint encodes both spectral and dynamical properties of the message-induced graph, the resulting hash exhibits strong sensitivity to input perturbations and provides a structurally rich foundation for post-quantum hashing. To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, we implement QGH-256 on a 4 X 4 toroidal grid, chosen empirically: smaller grids exhibit collisions, whereas larger grids significantly increase execution time.

The protocol measures logical observables at a series of accessible finite energies and extrapolates the results to the ideal, infinite-energy limit using an ansatz based on the code's asymptotic error scaling. Through simulating a GKP qubit under a pure-loss channel, we demonstrate that ES-ZNE successfully mitigates finite-energy errors, recovering the ideal expectation values (within numerical uncertainty) in the shallow-noise regime. Furthermore, by computationally removing artifacts arising from the finite-energy encoding, our method characterizes the intrinsic performance of the ideal GKP code, revealing a sharp error threshold beyond which the code's corrective power diminishes.

In particular, we consider how such fan-out operations and qudits can be used to implement circuits which are challenging for distributed quantum computation, involving pairwise qubit interactions, i.e., what has been called global gates (a.k.a. global Mølmer-Sørensen gates). Such gates have been explored to possibly yield more efficient computations via reduced circuit depth, and can be carried out efficiently in some types of quantum hardware (e.g., trapped-ion quantum computers); we consider this as an exploration of an ``extreme'' case for distribution given the global qubit-qubit interactions. We also conclude with some implications for future work on quantum circuit compilation and quantum data centre design."}

However, conventional cavity-assisted cooling is fundamentally constrained by cavity dissipation and environmental noise, limiting the attainable minimum temperature. In this work, we propose a non-Hermitian optomechanical cooling scheme through nonreciprocal coupling between two levitated nanoparticles, where one particle is directly cooled by an optical cavity and the other is cooled indirectly through a non-Hermitian interaction. Both analytical solutions and numerical simulations reveal that increasing nonreciprocity enhances directional energy transfer, enabling the target particle to reach a lower phonon occupation than is achievable in conventional cavity cooling. This study demonstrates a new cooling mechanism driven by non-Hermitian interactions, offering theoretical guidance for realizing controllable energy flow and deep cooling in levitated optomechanical systems, and paving the way for future developments in quantum control and sensing technologies."}

Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to bridge this gap, but a practical camera-based vector magnetometry implementation on relevant microstructures has not been demonstrated. Here we adapt a commercial widefield microscope to implement a camera-compatible pulsed optically detected magnetic resonance protocol to reconstruct stray-field vectors from microscale devices.

To date, the existing proposals for fault-tolerant quantum algorithms for CFD have almost exclusively been based on the Carleman embedding method, used to encode nonlinearities on a quantum computer. In this work, we begin by showing that these proposals suffer from a range of severe bottlenecks that negate conjectured quantum advantages: lack of convergence of the Carleman method, prohibitive time-stepping requirements, unfavorable condition number scaling, and inefficient data extraction. With these roadblocks clearly identified, we develop a novel algorithm for the incompressible lattice Boltzmann equation that circumvents these obstacles, and then provide a detailed analysis of our algorithm, including all potential sources of algorithmic complexity, as well as gate count estimates. We find that for an end-to-end problem, a modest quantum advantage may be preserved for selected observables in the high-error-tolerance regime. We lower bound the Reynolds number scaling of our quantum algorithm in dimension $D$ at Kolmogorov microscale resolution with $O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{4}(1+\\frac{D}{2})} \\times q_M)$, where $q_M$ is a multiplicative overhead for data extraction with $q_M = O(\\mathrm{Re}^{\\frac{3}{8}})$ for the drag force.

However, the memory requirement would become a bottleneck for classical computing as the electromagentic problems become much larger. As an alternative, quantum computing has a natural \"parallelization\" advantage with much lower storage complexity due to the superposition and entanglement in quantum mechanics. Even though several quantum algorithms have been applied for the SIEs-based methods in the literature, the size of the matrix equation systems solvable using them is still limited. In this work, we use a hybrid quantum-classical scheme to solve the EFIE for analyzing electromagentic scattering from three-dimensional (3D) perfect electrically conducting objects with arbitrary shapes in CEM for the first time. Instead of directly solving the original EFIE matrix equation system using the quantum algorithms, the hybrid scheme first designs the preconditioned linear system and then uses a double-layer iterative strategy for its solution, where the external iteration layer builds subspace matrix equation systems with smaller dimension and the internal iteration layer solves the smaller systems using the quantum algorithms. Two representative quantum algorithms, HHL and VQLS, are considered in this work, which are executed on the quantum simulator and quantum computer platforms. We present the theoretical time complexity analysis of the hybrid quantum-classical scheme and perform numerical experiments to investigate the accuracy and efficiency of the hybrid scheme.

In many examples of interacting quantum systems and random matrix models, this procedure is known to provide a reasonably accurate approximation to the exact numerical density of states. We review some of the examples that are known in the literature where this procedure works very well, and also discuss some of the limitations of this method in situations where the free probability approximation fails to provide a sufficiently accurate description of the exact density of states. Subsequently, we describe a perturbation scheme that can be developed from the subordination formulas for the Cauchy transform of the density of states and use it to obtain approximate analytical expressions for the density of states in various models, such as the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensemble and the Anderson model with on-site disorder."}

To help address this, we perform full 3D simulations of conveyor-belt charge shuttling in a realistic SiMOS device, building on earlier 2D modelling. We solve the Poisson and time-dependent Schrodinger equations for varying shuttling speeds and gate voltages, focusing on potential pitfalls of typical SiMOS devices such as oxide-interface roughness, gate fabrication imperfections, and charge defects along the transport path. The simulations reveal that for low clavier-gate voltages, the additional oxide screening in multi-layer gate architectures causes conveyor-belt shuttling to collapse to the bucket-brigade mode, inducing considerable orbital excitation in the process. Increasing the confinement restores conveyor-belt operation, which we find to be robust against interface roughness, gate misalignment, and charge defects buried in the oxide. However, our results indicate that defects located at the Si/SiO2-interface can induce considerable orbital excitation. For lower conveyor gate biases, positive defects in the transport channel can even capture passing electrons. Hence we identify key challenges and find operating regimes for reliable charge transport in SiMOS architectures."}

Since the number of relevant input and output modes may differ, resulting in an open quantum system, we introduce the generalized Bloch-Messiah decomposition (GBMD), reducing the description to an equal number of input and output modes. The GBMD enables us to calculate the multimode Wigner function of the output state by convolving the rescaled Wigner function of the reduced input quantum pulse with a multivariate Gaussian phase-space function. We expand on this result by considering two examples input states: A Fock state in a single broadband mode and a two-mode squeezed vacuum, both in the THz-frequency regime, up-converted to a single output broadband mode of optical frequencies. We investigate the effect, the convolution and thermalization due to entanglement breakage have on the output Wigner function by calculating the von Neumann entropy of the output Wigner function.

Previous approaches have employed non-interacting classical ensembles of trajectories, or perturbation theory utilizing the classical trajectories as a starting point, missing out key entanglement features. In this Letter, we develop a full quantum theory for entanglement measures in HHG solving exactly the light-matter interaction Hamiltonian and employ it for evaluating the entanglement between emitted photons of different harmonics. For the first time, we reach qualitative agreement of theory with recent experiments showing that the R entanglement parameter decreases with increasing laser power for below-threshold harmonics. Our results indicate that fine-tuning the laser power could enhance HHG entanglement features, which are observed to oscillate with the driving power and exhibit local non-classical maxima structures. Similarly, our theory predicts that the oscillatory behavior of entanglement observed for below-threshold harmonics also appears for entanglement involving above-threshold harmonics. We also show that the long-range behavior of driven electronic trajectories can qualitatively change the resulting entanglement. Lastly, we show that focal averaging over classical degrees of freedom, which has thus far been ignored in quantum HHG theories, plays a key role in entanglement measures and can change the qualitative behavior of observables. Our work establishes the state-of-the art in exploring entanglement features in HHG, and paves way for analysis and engineering of 'truly-quantum' multi-photon states in the XUV and ultrafast regime for more complex matter systems."}

The simplicity of the protocol makes it a promising tool for rapid, controlled thermalization in quantum thermodynamics experiments and state preparation."}

Bell's result was originally proven in a simple bipartite causal structure, but analogous results have also been shown in further causal structures. Here we study the only causal structure with six or fewer nodes in which the question of whether or not there exist quantum correlations that cannot be achieved classically was open. In this causal structure we show that such quantum correlations exist using a method that involves imposing additional restrictions on the correlations. This hence completes the picture of which causal structures of up to six nodes support non-classical quantum correlations. We also provide further illustrations of our method using other causal structures."}
