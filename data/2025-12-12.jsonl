In this letter, we introduce a unified protocol for quantifying the resource-generating power (RGP) of arbitrary quantum evolutions applicable to multiple QRTs. It is based on deep thermalization (DT), which has recently gained attention for its role in the emergence of quantum state designs from partial projective measurements. Central to our approach is the use of projected ensembles, recently employed to probe DT, together with new twirling identities that allow us to directly infer the RGP of the underlying dynamics. These identities further reveal how resources build up and thermalize in generic quantum circuits. Finally, we show that quantum resources themselves undergo deep thermalization at the subsystem level, offering a complementary and another experimentally accessible route to infer the RGP. Our work connects deep thermalization to resource quantification, offering a new perspective on the essential role of various resources in generating state designs."}

Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources."}

These departures--termed quantumness here--power quantum information and computation. This thesis charts the role of discrete structures in assessing quantumness, synthesizing elements of my postdoctoral research through this lens. After an introduction to the necessary background concepts, I present my work under three broad categories. First, I present work on contextuality that extensively relies on (undirected) graphs and hypergraphs as the discrete structures of interest; more specifically, it relies on invariants associated with them. This work includes Kochen-Specker (KS) contextuality and its operationalization to generalized contextuality, expressed via (hyper)graph-theoretic frameworks. I also present work on KS-contextuality in multiqubit systems and an application of generalized contextuality to a one-shot communication task, both of which rely on hypergraphs. Second, I present work on causality, where the discrete structures of interest are directed graphs. This includes work on indefinite causal order, specifically its connections to the gap between local operations and classical communication (LOCC) and separable operations (SEP), and a device-independent notion of nonclassicality--termed antinomicity--that generalizes Bell nonlocality without global causal assumptions. Finally, I present work on the incompatibility of quantum measurements, its connection to Bell nonlocality, and its role in discriminating between quantum and almost quantum correlations in the single-system setting. The discrete structures of interest here are hypergraphs that model joint measurability relations between quantum measurements. I conclude with a summary and an overview of work that is not covered in this thesis."}

In our recent work we showed that the rate of fluctuation growth for an observable in a closed quantum system is upper bounded by the fluctuation of its corresponding velocity-like observable. That bound also indicated a tradeoff between the time derivatives of the mean and the standard deviation. In this paper we will look at open quantum systems in two cases. For the first case we find the generator of evolution for an open system employing both the Taylor expansion and the standard time-ordered evolution via the Dyson series, while in the second case we consider no specific information about the evolution of the system. We then find the rate of fluctuation growth in each case. Comparing the upper bounds for each case and considering the upper bound found for a closed system suggest that including more details by separating the contributions of the system and state dynamics seems to result in looser bounds for the rate of fluctuation growth."}

The entropic uncertainty relation with quantum memory offers a powerful way to study how shared entanglement affects measurement precision. However, under acceleration, the Unruh effect can degrade quantum correlations, raising questions about the reliability of QMA-EUR in such settings. Here, we investigate the QMA-EUR for two uniformly accelerating Unruh-DeWitt detectors coupled to a massless scalar field. Using the Kossakowski-Lindblad master equation, we calculate the entropic uncertainty, its lower bound, and the tightness of the relation under different Unruh temperatures. We find that acceleration does not always increase the lower bound on the uncertainty relation. Depending on the initial correlations between the detectors, it may either increase or decrease. This behavior results from the interplay between quantum discord and minimal missing information. Interestingly, a higher quantum discord does not necessarily lead to lower uncertainty."}

A long-standing open question is to determine the optimal number of uses of an unknown channel required to learn it in diamond distance, the standard measure of worst-case distinguishability between quantum processes. Here we show that a quantum channel acting on a $d$-dimensional system can be estimated to accuracy $\\varepsilon$ in diamond distance using $O(d^4/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses. This scaling is essentially optimal, as it matches lower bounds up to logarithmic factors. Our analysis extends to channels with input and output dimensions $d_{\\mathrm{in}}$ and $d_{\\mathrm{out}}$ and Kraus rank at most $k$, for which $O(d_{\\mathrm{in}} d_{\\mathrm{out}} k/\\varepsilon^2)$ channel uses suffice, interpolating between unitary and fully generic channels. As by-products, we obtain, to the best of our knowledge, the first essentially optimal strategies for operator-norm learning of binary POVMs and isometries, and we recover optimal trace-distance tomography for fixed-rank states. Our approach consists of using the channel only non-adaptively to prepare copies of the Choi state, purify them in parallel, perform sample-optimal pure-state tomography on the purifications, and analyse the resulting estimator directly in diamond distance via its semidefinite-program characterisation. While the sample complexity of state tomography in trace distance is by now well understood, our results finally settle the corresponding problem for quantum channels in diamond distance."}

The resulting non-Gaussian entanglement is further enhanced by single-photon catalysis, which purifies the distributed state after transmission through lossy channels. Using these purified ECS resources, we analyze a photon-number-based teleportation protocol and demonstrate high-fidelity transfer of both coherent states and Schrodinger cat states. In particular, the teleportation fidelity for cat states exceeds the classical threshold of 2/3 over a broad range of realistic channel and squeezing parameters, whereas Gaussian resources fail to do so.

Remarkably, the characteristic frequencies of this novel phase are not fixed but can be continuously tuned by varying the strength of the drive. Even more strikingly, this tunability is punctuated by Arnold tongues, within which the response main frequency locks to rational fractions of the drive. Our model further provides a unified framework that also encompasses stationary, discrete time crystals and chaotic phases.

In each pair a strong pump field is applied to activate either Stokes or anti-Stokes scattering. Due to the magnon mode involving in the two scattering processes and as a mediation, Stokes and anti-Stokes photons of different polarizations get entangled.

Our protocol consists of two steps and is based on the magnomechanical system where the magnetostrictively induced displacement further couples to an optical cavity mode via radiation pressure. We first prepare a squeezed mechanical state by driving the magnomechanical system with a two-tone microwave field. We then switch off the microwave drives and send a weak red-detuned optical pulse to the optical cavity to weakly activate the optomechanical anti-Stokes scattering. We show that $k$ phonons can be subtracted from the prepared squeezed state, conditioned on the detection of $k$ anti-Stokes photons from the cavity output field, which prepares the mechanical motion in a cat-like state. The work provides a new avenue for preparing mechanical superposition states by combining opto- and magnomechanics and may find applications in the study of macroscopic quantum states and the test of collapse theories."}

The performance of quantum error correction (QEC) is generally predicted through large-scale numerical simulations, used to estimate thresholds, finite-size scaling, and exponential suppression of logical errors below threshold. The connection of QEC to models from statistical mechanics provides an alternative tool for analysing QEC performance. However, predicting the behaviour of these models also requires large-scale numerical simulations, as analytic solutions are not generally known. Here we exploit an exact mapping, from a toric code under bit-flip noise that is post-selected on being syndrome free to the exactly-solvable two-dimensional Ising model on a torus, to derive an analytic solution for the logical failure rate across its full domain of physical error rates. In particular, this mapping provides closed-form expressions for the logical failure rate in four distinct regimes: the path-counting, below-threshold (ordered), near-threshold (critical), and above-threshold (disordered) regimes. Our framework places a number of familiar and long-standing numerical observations on firm theoretical ground. It also motivates explicit ansätze for the conventional QEC setting of non-post-selected codes whose statistical mechanics mappings involve random-bond disorder. Specifically, we introduce an effective surface tension model for the below-threshold regime, and a new scaling ansatz for the near-threshold regime, derived from an analysis of the ground state energy cost distribution. By bridging statistical mechanics theory and quantum error correction practice, our results offer a new toolkit for designing, benchmarking, and understanding topological codes beyond current computational limits."}

Away from the jump the dynamics is adiabatic, while the sign flip produces a single nonadiabatic kick in the adiabatic basis. Within a simple stepwise adiabatic-sudden approximation we obtain a compact analytic expression for the final transition probability, identify the parameter regimes that yield high-fidelity inversion, and show that the result depends only on the change of the mixing angle across the detuning jump, i.e., solely on the ratio of the peak Rabi frequency to the detuning. Numerical simulations of the full time-dependent Schrödinger equation confirm the validity and robustness of this description over a broad parameter range.\n  We then use the Majorana decomposition to extend the scheme to an SU(2)-symmetric three-state chain driven by the same coupling and detuning functions. In this setting the three-state propagator is expressed in closed form through the two-level Cayley-Klein parameters, which allows us to derive explicit transition probabilities for all three initial states.

Recent efforts have applied variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) based methods to compute waveguide modes, demonstrating the feasibility of simulating TE and TM field distributions on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. However, these studies typically employ manually designed, fixed-depth parameterized quantum circuits and uniform measurement-shot strategies, resulting in excessive quantum resource consumption, limited circuit expressivity, and reduced robustness under realistic noise conditions. To address these limitations, we propose an architecture and shot adaptive subspace variational quantum eigensolver for efficient microwave waveguide eigenmode simulation on NISQ devices. The proposed framework integrates a reinforcement learning (RL) based circuit design strategy and an adaptive shot allocation mechanism to jointly reduce quantum resource overhead. Specifically, the RL agent autonomously explores the quantum circuit space to generate hardware-efficient parameterized quantum circuits, while the adaptive measurement scheme allocates sampling resources according to Hamiltonian term weights. Numerical experiments on three- and five-qubit systems demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves accurate estimation of TE and TM mode eigenvalues, with a minimum absolute error down to $10^{-8}$ and reconstructed field distributions under noiseless conditions in excellent agreement with classical electromagnetic solutions."}

First, we propose two estimation algorithms for DSEU with these accesses utilizing the randomized measurement toolbox. The query complexities of these algorithms are both $O(\\sqrt{d})$.

First, I study scrambling and pseudorandomness in the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, quantifying pseudorandomness using unitary k-designs and frame potentials. Using Keldysh path integrals with replicas and disorder averaging, I obtain analytic control of the approach to randomness, identify collective modes that delay convergence to Haar-like behavior, and estimate design times as functions of model parameters, clarifying links between scrambling, complexity growth, and random-circuit phenomenology. Second, I construct a field theory for weakly measured SYK clusters. Starting from a system-ancilla description and a continuum monitoring limit, and using fermionic coherent states with replicas and disorder averaging, I derive a nonlinear sigma model that captures measurement back-action and the competition between interaction-induced scrambling and information extraction, predicting characteristic crossover scales and response signatures that distinguish weak monitoring from fully unitary evolution. Third, I develop a strong-disorder renormalization group for measurement-only SYK clusters, based on the SO(2n) replica algebra and Dasgupta-Ma decimation rules. The flow shows features reminiscent of infinite-randomness behavior, but an order-of-limits subtlety renders the leading recursions non-robust, so the analytic evidence for an infinite-randomness fixed point is inconclusive, even though the average second Renyi entropy displays logarithmic scaling. Together, these results provide a unified language to diagnose when many-body dynamics generate operational randomness and how measurements redirect that flow."}

In this work, we prove that multiple QPUs connected through slow interconnects can outperform a monolithic architecture made with a single QPU. We consider a distributed quantum computing model with the following assumptions: (1) each QPU is linked to only two other QPUs, (2) each link produces only one Bell pair at a time, (3) the time to generate a Bell pair is $τ_e$ times longer than the gate time. We propose a distributed version of the CliNR partial error correction scheme respecting these constraints and we show through circuit level simulations that, even if the entanglement generation time $τ_e$ is up to five times longer than the gate time, distributed CliNR can achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a shorter depth than both the direct implementation and the monolithic CliNR implementation of random Clifford circuits. In the asymptotic regime, we relax assumption (2) and we prove that links producing $O(t/\\ln t)$ Bell pairs in parallel, where $t$ is the number of QPUs, is sufficient to avoid stalling distributed CliNR, independently of the number of qubits per QPU. This demonstrates the potential of distributed CliNR for near-term multi-QPU devices. Moreover, we envision a distributed quantum superiority experiment based on the conjugated Clifford circuits of Bouland, Fitzsimons and Koh implemented with distributed CliNR."}

As continuous-variable (CV) platforms play an increasingly important role in quantum information processing, it becomes crucial to understand the fundamental limitations of cooling bosonic systems. In this work, we develop a general framework for cooling CV systems, identifying both the constraints imposed by Gaussianity and the advantages enabled by non-Gaussian interactions. We derive a reachable bound on the cooling performance of Gaussian operations that applies to arbitrary cooling architectures. By optimizing over all protocols saturating this bound, we further identify the most efficient scheme, which minimizes dissipated energy for a given number of ancilla modes. Beyond Gaussian operations, we show that $p$-excitation exchange exploits non-Gaussian resources to achieve a $p$-fold enhancement of the cooling limit. Our results establish the fundamental limits of CV heat-bath algorithmic cooling and reveal the crucial role of non-Gaussianity in surpassing Gaussian cooling barriers."}

Here, we demonstrate optical control of a bosonic quantum processor, achieving universal operations on the joint Hilbert space of a transmon qubit and a storage cavity. Using an array of cryogenic fiber-integrated uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes, we prepare Fock states containing up to ten photons. Additionally, remote control of bosonic modes over a transmission distance of 15 km has been achieved, with fidelities exceeding 95%. The combination of high-dimensional quantum control, multi-channel operation, and long-distance transmission addresses the key requirements for scaling superconducting quantum computers and enables architectures for distributed quantum data centers."}

However, their coherence properties are negatively affected by magnetic and electric surface noise, whose origin and detailed impact have remained elusive. Using atomistic models of diamond surfaces derived with density functional theory, together with decoherence time calculations with cluster correlation expansion methods, we quantify the effects of surface crystallographic orientation and functionalization, and of the density of unpaired electrons on the NV Hahn-echo time $T_2$. We determine a crossover depth at which $T_2$ ceases to be limited by surface nuclear spins and recovers the bulk-limited value. We find that for static surface-electron baths, the ratio between the NV depth and the separation between surface electron spins determines a transition from fast-fluctuating to quasi-static noise, leading to a dependence of $T_2$ on orientation for specific surfaces. We also find that the modulation of $T_2$ by spin-phonon relaxations leads to motional-narrowing at sub-microsecond relaxation times. Importantly, our calculations show that it is only when accounting for surface-spin in-sequence hopping that measured $T_2$ values as a function of depth can be reproduced, thus highlighting the importance of hopping-mediated models to describe the surface spin noise affecting NV sensors. Overall, our work provides clear guidelines for engineering diamond surfaces to achieve enhanced NV coherence for quantum sensing and information processing applications."}

This fundamental concept can serve as a subroutine for quantum algorithms that involve Bayesian inference and Monte Carlo methods, or that require data encryption, like in blind quantum computation. In this work, we present a characterisation of the complexity of the quantum-to-quantum Bernoulli factory by providing a lower bound on the required number of qubits needed to implement the protocol, an upper bound on the success probability and the quantum circuit that saturates the bounds.

As the size of TSP instances grows, traditional algorithms often struggle to produce high-quality solutions within reasonable timeframes.

We adopt a QUBO-based formulation of TSP that integrates real-world logistical constraints reflecting operational conditions, such as vehicle capacity, road accessibility, and time windows, while ensuring compatibility with the limitations of current quantum hardware. Our experiments are conducted in a simulated environment using high-performance computing (HPC) resources to assess QAOA's performance across different problem sizes and quantum circuit depths. In order to improve scalability, we propose clustering QAOA (Cl-QAOA), a hybrid approach combining classical machine learning with QAOA. This method decomposes large TSP instances into smaller sub-problems, making quantum optimization feasible even on devices with a limited number of qubits. The results offer a comprehensive evaluation of QAOA's strengths and limitations in solving constrained TSP scenarios.

Using a likelihood function that is tractable for small DEMs, we show that DEMs estimated directly from syndromes agree more closely with unseen syndromes than DEMs trained to optimize logical performance, whereas the latter outperform the former as priors for decoders in logical memory experiments. We used a time-series of estimated DEMs to track both global error and specific local errors over the course of a QEC experiment, suggesting applications in online characterization. We employ a sequence of DEM estimation techniques to discover and quantify long-range detector correlations spanning the width of the 105-qubit chip, for which DEM analysis suggests correlated measurement errors rather than high-weight Pauli errors as the most likely explanation. Finally, we present two artifacts in repetition code syndromes that are \\emph{not} well-modeled by a DEM: correlated flipping of pairs of adjacent detectors in many consecutive rounds of QEC, and signatures consistent with radiation events occurring more frequently than previously reported."}

The package operates as follows: given a multipartite quantum state as input, it outputs an estimate of its geometric entanglement. For pure states, it computes the geometric entanglement together with an estimation error. For mixed states, it provides both lower and upper bounds on the geometric entanglement, thereby identifying an interval in which the true value lies. We provide several methods to compute the lower bound, enabling users to balance accuracy against computational cost. We apply entcalc to several representative examples, including for $3\\otimes3$ PPT entangled states, mixtures of GHZ and W states, thermal states of selected three-qubit spin chains, and noisy GHZ and W states. We observe signatures of quantum phase transitions by quantifying entanglement in spin chains. We also demonstrate that entanglement between non-neighbouring sites can be activated by tuning the external magnetic field. In all tested cases, the gap between the lower and upper bounds is found to be very small, indicating that entcalc provides highly accurate estimates of the geometric entanglement for these states."}

Most studies to date, however, implicitly invoke the scalar approximation, which is not appropriate in the context of high-numerical-aperture microscopy. Utilizing parameter estimation theory, here we consider the estimation of separation between two closely spaced dipole emitters, a commonly employed model for single-molecule optical beacons. We consider two limiting cases: one in which the orientations of the emitters are fixed and equal, and another in which both dipoles freely sample all of orientation space over the course of the measurement. We quantify precision limits using quantum and classical variants of the Fisher information and Cramér-Rao bound. In all cases, the vectorial nature of the emission complicates the analyses, but with appropriate filtering of the collected light in the azimuthal-radial polarization basis, a previously proposed scheme to saturate the quantum Fisher information via image inversion interferometry can be salvaged."}

Using this class, we show that for natural oracle problems, noise can eliminate exponential quantum learning advantages of ideal noiseless learners while preserving a superpolynomial gap between NISQ and fault-tolerant devices. Beyond oracle separations, we study concrete noisy learning tasks. For purity testing, the exponential two-copy advantage collapses under a single application of local depolarizing noise. Nevertheless, we identify a setting motivated by AdS/CFT in which noise-resilient structure restores a quantum learning advantage in a noisy regime. We then analyze noisy Pauli shadow tomography, deriving lower bounds that characterize how instance size, quantum memory, and noise control sample complexity, and design algorithms with parametrically similar scalings. Together, our results show that the Bell-basis and SWAP-test primitives underlying most exponential quantum learning advantages are fundamentally fragile to noise unless the experimental system has latent noise-robust structure. Thus, realizing meaningful quantum advantages in future experiments will require understanding how noise-robust physical properties interface with available algorithmic techniques."}
