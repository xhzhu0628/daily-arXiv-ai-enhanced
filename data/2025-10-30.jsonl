Simulating such two-local\nHamiltonian dynamics remains a major challenge, as methods with controllable\naccuracy require circuit depths that increase at least linearly with system\nsize, exceeding the capabilities of current quantum devices. The eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis predicts that these systems should thermalize, a\nbehavior confirmed in small-scale classical simulations. In this work, we\ninvestigate flavor thermalization in much larger systems using random quantum\ncircuits as an empirical tool to emulate the non-local dynamics, and\ndemonstrate that the thermal behavior can be reproduced using a depth\nindependent of the system size. By simulating dynamics of over one hundred\nqubits, we find that the thermalization time grows approximately as the square\nroot of the system size, consistent with predictions from semi-classical\nmethods. Beyond this specific result, our study illustrates that near-term\nquantum devices are useful tools to test and validate empirical classical\nmethods.

Here we extend this framework to a\ngeneralized setting where the target becomes $S_1\\otimes\\cdots\\otimes S_n$,\nwith each $S_i$ representing identical or distinct quantum states, detectors,\nor processes from the same category. We formulate these tasks as optimization\nproblems and develop three algorithms for collective quantum state, detector\nand process tomography, respectively, each accompanied by an analytical\ncharacterization of the computational complexity and mean squared error (MSE)\nscaling. Furthermore, we develop optimal solutions of these optimization\nproblems using sum of squares (SOS) techniques with semi-algebraic constraints.\nThe effectiveness of our proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical\nexamples. Additionally, we experimentally demonstrate the algorithms using\ntwo-copy collective measurements, where entangled measurements directly provide\ninformation about the state purity. Compared to existing methods, our\nalgorithms achieve lower MSEs and approach the collective MSE bound by\neffectively leveraging purity information."}
