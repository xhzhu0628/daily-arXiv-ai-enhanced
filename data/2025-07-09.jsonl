When the coupling strength of\nlight-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and\nmatter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating)\nprocesses, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created\nor annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between\nlight and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for\nnoise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum\ntechnologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant\ninteractions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium\nsuperradiant phase transitions.Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting\nof a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving\nultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective\nmagnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term.\nWe experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz\n- direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative\nenhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of\nremote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform\nfacilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant\ninteractions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling\nnoise-tolerant quantum technological applications."}

As a result, a metrological analog to Liouville's theorem appears;\nstatistical distances, volumes, and curvatures are invariant under the\nevolution generated by the Lie algebra.

In\nsuperconducting implementations, increasing the microwave drive on the\nnonlinear oscillator that hosts the Kerr-cat qubit should, in principle,\nfurther enhance this bias. Instead, experiments reveal that above a critical\ndrive amplitude the tunneling time - the less dominant decay channel - ceases\nto increase and even decreases. Here, we show that this breakdown arises from\nthe multimode nature of the circuit implementation: specifically, the buffer\nmode used to control the Kerr-cat qubit can induce multiphoton resonances that\nsharply degrade Kerr-cat coherence if its frequency is not carefully chosen. We\nuncover this mechanism by retaining the full circuit nonlinearities and\ntreating the strong drive exactly within a Floquet-Markov framework that\nincorporates quasidegeneracies in the Kerr-cat spectrum.
