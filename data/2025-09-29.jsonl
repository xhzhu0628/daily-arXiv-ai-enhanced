Radical pair spin dynamics simulations including all nuclear spins\nhave been a computational barrier due to exponential scaling memory\nrequirements. We address this issue with a tensor network method for accurately\nsimulating the full open quantum dynamics of radical pair systems, explicitly\naccounting for hyperfine interactions with up to 30 nuclear spins with\nadditional benchmarking including 60 nuclei. By employing the matrix product\nstate (MPS) and matrix product density operator (MPDO) representations, we\nmitigate the exponential scaling of Hilbert and Liouville spaces typically\nencountered in full quantum non-Markovian treatments. We demonstrate the power\nof these methods with biologically relevant flavin-tryptophan radical pair\nsystems, where we investigate electron hopping processes between multiple\nradical pairs using Lindblad jump operators. These simulations precisely\ncapture anisotropic spin dynamics, clearly identifying orientational dependence\nof the magnetic field, which enhances or diminishes the spin-selective product\nyield.

A\ntextbook example is the estimation of a classical field's amplitude using a\ntwo-level probe, as described by the semi-classical Rabi model. In this work,\nwe explore the fully quantum analogue, where the amplitude of a coherent\nquantized field is estimated by letting it interact with a two-level atom. For\nboth metrological scenarios, we focus on the quantum Fisher information (QFI)\nof the reduced state of the atomic probe. In the semi-classical Rabi model, the\nQFI is independent of the field amplitude and grows quadratically with the\ninteraction time $\\tau$. In contrast, when the atom interacts with a single\ncoherent mode of the field, the QFI is bounded by 4, a constant dictated by the\nnon-orthogonality of coherent states. We find that this bound can only be\napproached in the vacuum limit. In the limit of large amplitude $\\alpha$, the\nQFI is found to attain its maximal value $1.47$ at $\\tau =O(1)$ and $\\tau\n=O(\\alpha^2)$, and also shows periodic revivals at much later times.

Specifically, we present the protocol how to translate arbitrary linear\ntransformations into the coin and step operator of a quantum walk and map these\nto the experimental parameters of the established time-multiplexed platform. We\nshow that our interface is highly scalable and resource-efficient due to the\nhybrid encoding consisting of multiple degrees of freedom. Finally, we prove\nthat our system is highly resilient against experimental imperfections and show\nthat it compares favorably against existing architectures."}

However, current implementations suffer from two key\nlimitations: lack of controllability over generated outputs and severe\ngeneration bias towards certain expected patterns. We present a Controllable\nQuantum Generative Framework, ConQuER, which addresses both challenges through\na modular circuit architecture. ConQuER embeds a lightweight controller circuit\nthat can be directly combined with pre-trained IQP circuits to precisely\ncontrol the output distribution without full retraining. Leveraging the\nadvantages of IQP, our scheme enables precise control over properties such as\nthe Hamming Weight distribution with minimal parameter and gate overhead. In\naddition, inspired by the controller design, we extend this modular approach\nthrough data-driven optimization to embed implicit control paths in the\nunderlying IQP architecture, significantly reducing generation bias on\nstructured datasets. ConQuER retains efficient classical training properties\nand high scalability. We experimentally validate ConQuER on multiple quantum\nstate datasets, demonstrating its superior control accuracy and balanced\ngeneration performance, only with very low overhead cost over original IQP\ncircuits. Our framework bridges the gap between the advantages of quantum\ncomputing and the practical needs of controllable generation modeling."}

The\nrelativistic kinetic energy is approximated through a perturbative expansion of\nthe total kinetic Hamiltonian, incorporating higher-order momentum terms.

Similar\nto the original Hamiltonian model introduced by Fendley, these circuits are\ndefined by the fact that the Floquet operator corresponding to a single time\nstep can not be diagonalized by means of any Jordan-Wigner transformation, but\nstill displays a free-fermionic spectrum. Our construction makes use of\nsuitable non-local transfer matrices commuting with the Floquet operator,\nallowing us to establish the free fermionic spectrum.

One\nprominent example is the quantum double-slit experiment due to Feynman (1951,\n1966). A related non-quantum example, inspired by Boole (1862) and Vorob$'$ev\n(1962), has three two-valued random variables $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, where the pairs\n$X, Y$ and $X, Z$ are perfectly correlated, yet $Y, Z$ are perfectly\nanti-correlated. Such examples can be accommodated using a ``multi-measurable''\nspace with several different $ \\sigma $-algebras of measurable events. This\nconcept due to Vorob$'$ev (1962) allows construction of: 1) a measurable\nmeta\\-space whose elements combine a point in the original sample space with a\nvariable ``contextual'' Boolean algebra; 2) a parametric family of probability\nmeta\\-spaces, each of which is a Kolmogorov probability space that represents a\ntwo-stage stochastic process where a random choice from the original sample\nspace is preceded by the random choice of a contextual Boolean algebra in the\nmulti-measurable space. Subsequent work will explore how quantum experimental\nresults can be described using a quantum measurement tree with one or more\npreparation nodes where an experimental configuration is determined that\ngoverns the probability distribution of relevant quantum observables."}

Here any\nsuch observable is identified with: (i) an ``ortho-measurable'' function\ndefined on the Boolean ``ortho-algebra'' generated by the eigenspaces that form\nan orthogonal decomposition of $ \\C^n $; (ii) a ``numerically identified''\northogonal decomposition of $ \\C^n $. The latter means that each subspace of\nthe orthogonal decomposition can be uniquely identified by its own attached\nreal number, just as each eigenspace of a Hermitian matrix can be uniquely\nidentified by the corresponding eigenvalue. Furthermore, any density matrix on\n$ \\C^n $ is identified with a Bayesian prior ``ortho-probability'' measure\ndefined on the linear subspaces that make up the Boolean ortho-algebra induced\nby its eigenspaces. Then any pure quantum state is identified with a degenerate\ndensity matrix, and any mixed state with a probability measure on a set of\northogonal pure states.
