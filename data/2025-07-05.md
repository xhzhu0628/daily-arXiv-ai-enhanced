### [1] [Switchable coherent state stored quantum batteries with large ergotropies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02012)
*Y. F. Li,S. R. He,P. H. Ouyang,X. N. Feng,L. F. Wei*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 量子电池（QB）是一种新型能量存储和转换设备，通过量子纠缠资源显著提高充电效率。本文研究了如何实现可切换充电和无损功率检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子电池的充电和功率检测机制，以提升其实际应用性能。

Abstract: Quantum battery (QB) is a conceptually new energy storage and conversion
device, which consists usually of a quantum charger and an energy store (called
usually as the QB for simplicity). The demonstrated advantage of QB, over its
classical counterpart, is that its charging efficiency can be significantly
enhanced by using quantum entanglement resources. In this letter, we
investigate alternatively how to realize the switchable charging and the
lossless power detection of the charged QB. With the proposed QB configuration
we show that, by adjusting the eigenfrequency of the qubit-based charger, the
cavity-based QB can be switched on between the charging and power-off states
and its stored energy can be non-destructively monitored by probing the
transmitted spectrum of the external electromagnetic waves scattered by the
qubit-based charger. As the qubit-based charger has never been excited, the
proposed cavity-based QB could directly store the coherent state energy (rather
than the single-photon one) and thus possess significantly large ergotropy. The
physical realization of the proposed switchable QB configuration is
demonstrated specifically with the experimental circuit quantum
electrodynamical devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统量子过程层析方法在高维系统中计算复杂度高，需要更高效的协议。

Method: 通过随机态制备和Pauli基测量，以多项式复杂度实现层析，并扩展到包含非Clifford门的量子通道。

Result: 数值模拟验证了协议的理论可行性和高效性。

Conclusion: 该协议为高效量子过程层析提供了新思路，尤其适用于特定结构的量子通道。

Abstract: We present a quantum process tomography protocol based on a low-degree ansatz
for the quantum channel, i.e. when it can be expressed as a fixed-degree
polynomial in terms of Pauli operators. We demonstrate how to perform
tomography of such channels with a polynomial amount of effort relative to the
size of the system, by employing random state preparation and measurements in
the Pauli basis. We extend the applicability of the protocol to channels
consisting of a layer of quantum gates with a fixed number of non-Clifford
gates, followed by a low-degree noise channel. Rather than inverting the layer
of quantum gates in the hardware, which would introduce new errors, we
effectively carry out the inversion by classical post-processing while
maintaining the protocol's efficiency. Numerical simulations support our
theoretical findings and demonstrate the feasibility of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非厄米系统中复杂谱的出现使其难以精确控制和实际应用，因此需要一种可控生成实谱的方法。

Result: 开关过程伴随复能隙中的拓扑相变。

Conclusion: 为开发非厄米系统中增益和激光行为的选择性体-边界控制机制奠定了基础。

Abstract: The emergence of complex spectra in non-Hermitian systems causes dramatic
changes even under weak perturbations, significantly hindering their precise
control for study and integration into practical applications. Achieving a
controlled method to generate a real spectrum in non-Hermitian systems has long
been a key objective in the field. In this study, we explore the 2D
non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and introduce a reality switch
that allows for the controllable induction of a real spectrum depending on the
imposed boundary condition. We show that a topological phase transition in the
complex gap accompanies the switching process. Our work lays the cornerstone
for developing a selective bulk-boundary control mechanism for the gain and
lasing behaviors in non-Hermitian systems.

### [4] [Scaling Quantum Algorithms via Dissipation: Avoiding Barren Plateaus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02043)
*Elias Zapusek,Ivan Rojkov,Florentin Reiter*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 变分量子算法（VQAs）在近期量子设备上有广泛应用，但其可扩展性受限于梯度消失的“贫瘠高原”问题。本文提出基于非幺正通道的耗散量子算法，可避免贫瘠高原和噪声影响，并通过周期性重置辅助量子比特保持梯度，实现可扩展优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决变分量子算法在可扩展性和噪声鲁棒性上的局限性，提出一种新的耗散量子算法框架。

Method: 利用非幺正通道的耗散量子算法，通过周期性重置辅助量子比特主动提取熵，维持梯度大小。

Result: 理论分析和数值模拟表明，耗散量子算法在噪声环境下仍可训练，且在传统VQAs失效的场景中表现良好。

Conclusion: 耗散量子算法是一种可扩展且抗噪声的替代方案，优于传统变分量子算法。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) have enabled a wide range of
applications on near-term quantum devices. However, their scalability is
fundamentally limited by barren plateaus, where the probability of encountering
large gradients vanishes exponentially with system size. In addition, noise
induces barren plateaus, deterministically flattening the cost landscape.
Dissipative quantum algorithms that leverage nonunitary dynamics to prepare
quantum states via engineered cooling offer a complementary framework with
remarkable robustness to noise. We demonstrate that dissipative quantum
algorithms based on non-unital channels can avoid both unitary and
noise-induced barren plateaus. Periodically resetting ancillary qubits actively
extracts entropy from the system, maintaining gradient magnitudes and enabling
scalable optimization. We provide analytic conditions ensuring they remain
trainable even in the presence of noise. Numerical simulations confirm our
predictions and illustrate scenarios where unitary algorithms fail but
dissipative algorithms succeed. Our framework positions dissipative quantum
algorithms as a scalable, noise-resilient alternative to traditional VQAs.

Result: 发现噪声可以增强时间间隔或频率的估计，并展示了在量子比特和光子传感器网络中的具体协议。

Conclusion: 非相干动力学可作为计量资源，在特定条件下提升量子传感性能。

Abstract: I show that incoherent dynamics can lead to metrological advantages in
quantum sensing. The results rely on the fact that incoherent dynamics lead to
an additive contribution to the quantum Fisher information about time. Such an
additive contribution can lead to a decrease in the error of optimal estimation
protocols, as implied by the quantum Cram\'er-Rao bound. I characterize regimes
in which the estimation of a time interval or a frequency is enhanced by noise,
thus identifying cases where incoherent dynamics serve as a metrological
resource. I illustrate with protocols that display improved sensing of time
intervals or global fields by qubit and photonic sensor networks.

### [6] [Selective Feature Re-Encoded Quantum Convolutional Neural Network with Joint Optimization for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02086)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种选择性特征重编码策略和并行模式QCNN架构，以提高量子卷积神经网络在图像分类中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习（QML）在NISQ设备上的进步推动了QCNN的发展，但如何优化特征处理和架构设计以提高分类精度仍需探索。

Method: 提出选择性特征重编码策略和并行模式QCNN架构，结合PCA和自动编码器的特征提取方法。

Result: 实验表明，选择性特征重编码显著提升了量子电路的特征处理能力，并行QCNN架构在MNIST和Fashion MNIST数据集上表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为QCNN在图像分类中的应用提供了新方法，展示了其在精度和泛化能力上的优势。

Abstract: Quantum Machine Learning (QML) has seen significant advancements, driven by
recent improvements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices.
Leveraging quantum principles such as entanglement and superposition, quantum
convolutional neural networks (QCNNs) have demonstrated promising results in
classifying both quantum and classical data. This study examines QCNNs in the
context of image classification and proposes a novel strategy to enhance
feature processing and a QCNN architecture for improved classification
accuracy. First, a selective feature re-encoding strategy is proposed, which
directs the quantum circuits to prioritize the most informative features,
thereby effectively navigating the crucial regions of the Hilbert space to find
the optimal solution space. Secondly, a novel parallel-mode QCNN architecture
is designed to simultaneously incorporate features extracted by two classical
methods, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Autoencoders, within a unified
training scheme. The joint optimization involved in the training process allows
the QCNN to benefit from complementary feature representations, enabling better
mutual readjustment of model parameters. To assess these methodologies,
comprehensive experiments have been performed using the widely used MNIST and
Fashion MNIST datasets for binary classification tasks. Experimental findings
reveal that the selective feature re-encoding method significantly improves the
quantum circuit's feature processing capability and performance. Furthermore,
the jointly optimized parallel QCNN architecture consistently outperforms the
individual QCNN models and the traditional ensemble approach involving
independent learning followed by decision fusion, confirming its superior
accuracy and generalization capabilities.

ps optical pulses using non-linear photonics. We demonstrate single photon
production through a Hanbury Brown-Twiss measurement for one to six ions.

Result: 热模式使扭矩减小达2个数量级，温度还改变了扭矩的角度依赖性，偏离了典型的正弦行为。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计基于卡西米尔扭矩的纳米级传感器和设备提供了新思路。

Abstract: The Casimir effect, originating from quantum and thermal fluctuations, is
well known for inducing forces between closely spaced surfaces. When these
surfaces are optically anisotropic, these interactions can produce a Casimir
torque that rotates the surfaces relative to each other. We investigate, for
the first time, the influence of thermal fluctuations on the Casimir torque
between birefringent plates. Our results reveal that thermal modes
significantly diminish the torque, with reductions up to 2 orders of magnitude
for highly birefringent materials. Temperature is also shown to alter the
angular dependence of the torque, significantly deviating from the typical
sinusoidal behavior, and becomes particularly important at large separations
that exceed the thermal wavelength. Finally, we demonstrate that systems of
dissimilar birefringent plates that exhibit a distance-dependent reversal in
the torque's direction can enable precise control of the torque's magnitude and
sign through temperature manipulation. These findings advance our understanding
of quantum and thermal fluctuation interplay and provide a framework for
designing innovative nanoscale sensors and devices leveraging Casimir torque
phenomena.

Result: 证明了5-qubit AME态的等价性，构造了4-qubit纯码和无限族3-uniform态。

Conclusion: 通过理论工具解决了量子态的等价性问题，并扩展了量子纠错码的应用范围。

Abstract: We prove that every 5-qubit absolutely maximally entangled (AME) state is
equivalent by a local unitary transformation to a point in the unique ((5,2,3))
quantum error correcting code C. Furthermore, two points in C are equivalent if
and only if they are related by a group of order 24 acting on C. There exists a
set of 3 invariant polynomials that separates equivalence classes of 5-qubit
AME states. We also show that every 4-qubit pure code is equivalent to a
subspace of the unique ((4,4,2)) and construct an infinite family of 3-uniform
n-qubit states for even $n\geq 6$. The proofs rely heavily on results from
Vinberg and classical invariant theory.

Conclusion: 纠缠群为混合态纠缠提供了新的操作表征，揭示了可分态的纠缠来源。

Abstract: We extend an operational characterization of entanglement in terms of
stabilizer groups from pure states to mixed states. For a density matrix
$\rho_{AB}$, a stabilizer is a factorized unitary matrix $u_A \otimes u_B$
that, under conjugation, leaves $\rho_{AB}$ invariant. The entanglement group
is a quotient of the stabilizer group, in which one-party stabilizers are
considered trivial. This definition relates the entanglement of a density
matrix to the entanglement of its purification. We give general properties of
entanglement groups for mixed states, then discuss special properties for
separable states. For a separable state, the entanglement group may be
non-trivial. However it can only arise from multi-party entanglement with the
purifying system.

Abstract: We present a method characterizing thermal noise in an optical cavity
independent from quantum noise despite the thermal noise falling below the
quantum noise limit. Using this method, we measured the thermal noise
contribution from a GaAs AlGaAs micro-mirror suspended on a GaAs cantilever
microresonator when brought to a cryogenic temperature (approximately 25 K) and
incorporated into a Fabry Perot cavity. An optical spring is formed in this
optical cavity. Previously, this setup exploited an optical spring to produce a
displacement sensitivity falling 2.8 dB below the free-mass standard quantum
limit (SQL), as reported by Cullen et. al. Here we use a similar setup to
measure thermal noise which fell a maximum of 5 dB below the SQL. This
measurement, in turn, allowed for an investigation of quantum noise suppression
resulting from the optical spring effect, falling a maximum of 10 dB below the
SQL.

Abstract: The preparation of bright Schr\"odinger cat (SC) states is of great interest
for various areas of quantum technologies. In our previous paper, we proposed a
probabilistic procedure for preparing SC states using degenerate spontaneous
parametric down-conversion (SPDC) with depleting pump mode and subsequent
projective measurement in the pump mode. In this paper, we aim to provide our
interpretation of this process which is could be used to build more general
theory -- fully theoretical understanding of SPDC with depleting pump mode,
which is currently was not provided in quantum domain. We also report that
even-photon measurement also allows obtaining SC states, albeit less bright.

Abstract: A single quantum emitter coupled to a structured non-Hermitian environment
shows anomalous bound states and real-time dynamics without Hermitian
counterparts, as shown in [Gong et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 129, 223601 (2022)].
In this work, we establish a general approach for studying the scattering
states of a single quantum emitter coupled to one-dimensional non-Hermitian
single-band baths. We formally solve the exact eigenvalue equation for all the
scattering states defined on finite periodic lattices. In the thermodynamic
limit, the formal solution reduces to the celebrated Lippmann-Schwinger
equation for generic baths. In this case, we find that the scattering states
are no longer linear superpositions of plane waves in general, unlike those in
Hermitian systems; Instead, the wave functions exhibit a large, yet finite
localization length proportional to the lattice size. Furthermore, we show and
discuss the cases where the Lippmann-Schwinger equation breaks down. We find
the analytical solutions for the Hatano-Nelson and unidirectional
next-to-nearest-neighbor baths in the thermodynamic limit.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合偏置定制和单次纠错的量子编码方法，构建了新的层次化量子编码，优化了硬件开销和噪声适应性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子硬件中比特翻转（X）和相位翻转（Z）错误通常不均衡，偏置定制编码和单次纠错可以降低容错开销。

Method: 从超图乘积码出发，通过裁剪稳定器块构建了两种简化变体：简化码和缩减码，分别优化了硬件开销和噪声适应性。

Result: 简化码减少了物理比特数量并提升了最小距离，缩减码在特定噪声下保持单次纠错能力。

Conclusion: 这些偏置定制的单次纠错编码提供了灵活的硬件与噪声适应性权衡方案。

Abstract: Quantum hardware rarely suffers equal amounts of bit-flip ($X$) and
phase-flip ($Z$) errors; one type is often much more common than the other. A
code that is ``bias-tailored'' can exploit this imbalance, lowering the
fault-tolerance overhead. A complementary idea, called "single-shot" error
correction, aims to recover from data errors and noisy measurements in a single
round of stabilizer readout, avoiding slow repetition cycles. In this work, we
combine these two ideas and build a hierarchy of new quantum codes.
  The full construction starts from the syndrome-encoded hypergraph product
code and then tailors it to the dominant error type. The resulting code keeps
the single-shot guarantee for every noise model while boosting the threshold
whenever $X$ and $Z$ errors are asymmetric.
  By removing carefully chosen blocks of stabilizers we obtain two trimmed
variants. The first, called the simplified code, cuts the physical-qubit count
by $1/6$ and halves the number of stabilizer measurements, yet its minimum
distance grows quadratically compared to the standard design and its biased
noise threshold is unchanged. The second, called the reduced code, achieves the
same hardware savings but trades away single-shot protection for purely $X$ or
purely $Z$ noise; instead it remains single-shot under balanced, or
depolarizing, noise. In settings where strongly biased noise is likely, either
trimmed code offers a less resource-intensive alternative to the full
construction.
  As a concrete illustration, we lift the two-dimensional XZZX surface code to
a three-dimensional cubic lattice and show that this ``3D XZZX'' code is an
explicit member of the simplified family.
  Taken together, these bias-tailored single-shot codes provide an adjustable
set of code design alternatives, allowing tradeoffs between hardware overhead
and noise types.

Abstract: Quantum lock-in amplification raises the detection sensitivity of magnetic
fields to unprecedented level by phase-locked pumping the Zeeman levels of a
single trapped atom. To further enhance this sensitivity, quadrature squeezing
could be introduced to overcome the quantum uncertainty limit. We propose a
detection scheme using an atomic ensemble whose collected spin is pumped by two
lasers for simultaneous squeezing and phase locking. We derive the optimal
$\pi/2$-pulse and $\pi$-pulse schemes that accomplishes this concurrent action
and prove that the resulting phase sensitivity is enhanced while the usable
detection window for phase locking is widened.

Motivation: 现有混合态相位定义无法区分某些具有非平凡拓扑简并性的系统，如二维经典环系综。

Method: 通过局部可逆通道电路分析强弱对称性的局域变换及其对拓扑简并性的影响。

Result: 证明了精确定义能保持异常和对称性自发破缺，且二维经典环系综在局部可逆通道下仍具有非平凡拓扑简并性。

Conclusion: 精确定义揭示了混合态相位中拓扑简并性和对称性的新特性，为开放量子系统研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: We propose a refined definition of mixed-state phase equivalence based on
locally reversible channel circuits. We show that such circuits preserve
topological degeneracy and the locality of all operators including both strong
and weak symmetries. Under a locally reversible channel, weak unitary
symmetries are locally dressed into channel symmetries, a new generalization of
symmetry for open quantum systems. For abelian higher-form symmetries, we show
the refined definition preserves anomalies and spontaneous breaking of such
symmetries within a phase. As a primary example, a two-dimensional classical
loop ensemble is trivial under the previously adopted definition of mixed-state
phases. However, it has non-trivial topological degeneracy arising from a
mutual anomaly between strong and weak 1-form symmetries, and our results show
that it is not connected to a trivial state via locally reversible channel
circuits.

Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics have become a central research focus, exemplified by
the counterintuitive Mpemba effect where initially hotter systems can cool
faster than colder ones. Studied extensively in both classical and quantum
regimes, this phenomenon reveals diverse and complex behaviors across different
systems. This review provides a concise overview of the quantum Mpemba effect
(QME), specifically emphasizing its connection to symmetry breaking and
restoration in closed quantum many-body systems. We begin by outlining the
classical Mpemba effect and its quantum counterparts, summarizing key findings.
Subsequently, we introduce entanglement asymmetry and charge variance as key
metrics for probing the QME from symmetry perspectives. Leveraging these tools,
we analyze the early- and late-time dynamics of these quantities under
Hamiltonian evolution and random unitary circuits. We conclude by discussing
significant challenges and promising avenues for future research.

Abstract: The realization of a global quantum network holds the potential to enable
groundbreaking applications such as secure quantum communication and blind
quantum computing. However, building such a network remains a formidable
challenge, primarily due to photon loss in optical fibers. In this work, we
propose a quantum repeater architecture for distributing entanglement over
intercontinental distances by leveraging low-Earth-orbit satellites equipped
with spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) photon-pair sources and
ground stations utilizing single-atom memories in optical cavities and
single-photon detectors to implement the cavity-assisted photon scattering
(CAPS) gates for high-fidelity entanglement mapping. The efficient entanglement
swapping is achieved by performing high-fidelity Rydberg gates and readouts. We
evaluate the entanglement distribution rates and fidelities by analyzing
several key imperfections, including time-dependent two-photon transmission and
time-dependent pair fidelity, for various satellite heights and ground station
distances. We also investigate the impact of pair source fidelity and spin
decoherence rate on the repeater performance. Furthermore, we introduce a
spatial-frequency multiplexing strategy within this architecture to enhance the
design's performance. Finally, we discuss in detail the practical
implementation of this architecture. Our results show that this architecture
enables entanglement distribution over intercontinental distances. For example,
it can distribute over 10000 pairs per flyby over 10000 km with a fidelity
above 90%, surpassing the capabilities of terrestrial quantum repeaters

Motivation: Huong和Khoi报告了8/33的分性概率，但推导过程对一般读者不透明。本文旨在提供全面且自洽的推导。

Method: 通过计算量子态空间、旗流形和正则共伴轨道的Hilbert-Schmidt体积，并利用Duistermaat-Heckman测度与辛体积的联系。

Result: 成功重建并验证了8/33的可分性概率。

Conclusion: 本文通过几何和概率结构的结合，为这一基本常数提供了透明且严谨的推导路径。

Abstract: While the exact separability probability of 8/33 for two-qubit states under
the Hilbert-Schmidt measure has been reported by Huong and Khoi
[\href{https://doi.org/10.1088/1751-8121/ad8493}{J.Phys.A:Math.Theor.{\bf57},
445304(2024)}], detailed derivations remain inaccessible for general audiences.
This paper provides a comprehensive, self-contained derivation of this result,
elucidating the underlying geometric and probabilistic structures. We achieve
this by developing a framework centered on the computation of Hilbert-Schmidt
volumes for key components: the quantum state space, relevant flag manifolds,
and regular (co)adjoint orbits. Crucially, we establish and leverage the
connection between these Hilbert-Schmidt volumes and the symplectic volumes of
the corresponding regular co-adjoint orbits, formalized through the
Duistermaat-Heckman measure. By meticulously synthesizing these volume
computations -- specifically, the ratios defining the relevant probability
measures -- we reconstruct and rigorously verify the 8/33 separability
probability. Our approach offers a transparent pathway to this fundamental
constant, detailing the interplay between symplectic geometry, representation
theory, and quantum probability.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种广义张量变换（GTT）框架，通过任意$b \times b$酉矩阵的$n$重张量积构造，适用于经典和量子计算，显著降低了计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有变换（如傅里叶变换和沃尔什-哈达玛变换）在灵活性和计算效率上存在局限，GTT旨在提供一种更通用且高效的变换框架。

Method: 基于$n$重张量积构造GTT，提出快速经典算法（复杂度$O(N \log_b N)$）和量子算法（复杂度$O(\log_b N)$）。

Result: GTT在量子态压缩和函数编码中表现优于固定变换，保真度更高且所需保留分量更少。

Conclusion: GTT框架通过可调参数提供灵活性和高效性，适用于多种量子计算任务，具有显著优势。

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for Generalized Tensor Transforms (GTTs),
constructed through an $n$-fold tensor product of an arbitrary $b \times b$
unitary matrix $W$. This construction generalizes many established transforms,
by providing a adaptable set of orthonormal basis functions. Our proposed fast
classical algorithm for GTT achieves an exponentially lower complexity of $O(N
\log_b N)$ in comparison to a naive classical implementation that has an
associated computational cost of $O(N^2)$. For quantum applications, our
GTT-based algorithm, implemented in the natural spectral ordering, achieves
both gate complexity and circuit depth of $O(\log_b N)$, where $N = b^n$
denotes the length of the input vector. This represents a quadratic improvement
over Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which requires $O((\log_b N)^2)$ gates
and depth for $n$ qudits, and an exponential advantage over classical Fast
Fourier Transform (FFT) based and Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform (FWHT) based
methods, which incur a computational cost of $O(N \log_b N)$.
  We explore diverse applications of GTTs in quantum computing, including
quantum state compression and transmission, function encoding and quantum
digital signal processing. The proposed framework provides fine-grained control
of the transformation through the adjustable parameters of the base matrix $W$.
This versatility allows precise shaping of each basis function while preserving
their effective Walsh-type structure, thus tailoring basis representations to
specific quantum data and computational tasks. Our numerical results
demonstrate that GTTs enable improved performance in quantum state compression
and function encoding compared to fixed transforms (such as FWHT or FFT),
achieving higher fidelities with fewer retained components. We also provided
novel classical and quantum digital signal filtering algorithms based on our
GTT framework.

Conclusion: 异常配置的存在是硬币操作的局限性，新提出的硬币操作解决了这一问题。

Abstract: There exist two types of configurations of marked vertices on a
two-dimensional grid, known as the {\it exceptional configurations}, which are
hard to find by the discrete-time quantum walk algorithms. In this article, we
provide a comparative study of the quantum walk algorithm with different coins
to search these {\it exceptional configurations} on a two-dimensional grid. We
further extend the analysis to the hypercube, where only one type of {\it
exceptional configurations} are present. Our observation, backed by numerical
results, is that our recently proposed modified coin operator is the only coin
which can search both types of {\it exceptional configurations} as well as
non-{\it exceptional configurations} successfully. As a consequence, we observe
that the existence of {\it exceptional configurations} are not a quantum
phenomenon, rather a mere limitation of some of the coin operators.

Abstract: We theoretically propose a scheme to enhance the photon indistinguishability
of spectrally mismatched single photons via Floquet-engineered optical
frequency combs (OFCs) in cavity quantum electrodynamic systems. By
periodically modulating two distinct single-photon states under a modulation
frequency which is exactly equal to the spectral mismatch of two cavity modes,
a pair of single-photon frequency-comb (SPFC) states is prepared
energy-conservatively based on full unitary operations. The two states show
high indistinguishability with an ideal $g^{(2)}_\mathrm{HOM}(0)$ down to zero
due to the superposition of intensity-matched single-photon states coherently
distributed across the teeth of the combs.

Abstract: Embedding of a knowledge graph(KG) entities and relations in the form of
vectors is an important aspect for the manipulation of the KG database for
several downstream tasks, such as link prediction, knowledge graph completion,
and recommendation. Because of the growing size of the knowledge graph
databases, it has become a daunting task for the classical computer to train a
model efficiently. Quantum computer can help speedup the embedding process of
the KGs by encoding the entities into a variational quantum circuit of
polynomial depth. Usually, the time complexity for such variational
circuit-dependent quantum classical algorithms for each epoch is $\mathcal{O}(N
\mbox{poly}(\log M))$, where $N$ is number of elements in the knowledge graph
and $M$ is the number of features of each entities of the knowledge graph. In
this article we exploit additional quantum advantage by training multiple
elements of KG in superpositions, thereby reducing the computing time further
for the knowledge graph embedding model.

Conclusion: 在特定贝尔场景中，Popescu-Rohrlich盒分数可用于安全量子密钥分发，无需验证纠缠。

Abstract: With a measure of dimensionally restricted nonlocality in the bipartite Bell
scenario with two inputs and two outputs, a different decomposition of any
nonsignaling box that is a convex mixture of a single Popescu-Rohrlich box and
a Bell-local box, with the measure being zero, is introduced. It is shown that
any nonsignaling box shared by Alice and Bob that has dimensionally restricted
nonlocality contains secret correlations against any third party, Eve, who is
also dimensionally restricted. In this context, for the specific Bell scenario
considered, it is demonstrated that the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction can be
used as a resource for secure quantum key distribution even if entanglement is
not certified.

Method: 通过分析Bures角的时间导数，将演化速度上界分解为三个物理贡献：相干动力学、耗散变形和涨落项。

Result: 建立了一个将QSL与短时域内的量子Fisher信息联系起来的一般不等式，揭示了速度与估计精度之间的权衡关系。

Conclusion: 结果表明，退相干既能加速信息获取，又能限制其精度，为量子信息处理提供了新的理论支持。

Abstract: We derive a new quantum speed limit (QSL) for open quantum systems governed
by Markovian dynamics. By analyzing the time derivative of the Bures angle
between the initial pure state and its time-evolved state, we obtain an
analytically computable upper bound on the evolution speed that decomposes into
three distinct physical contributions; coherent unitary dynamics, dissipative
deformation, and a fluctuation term. Based on this structure, we establish a
general inequality that connects the QSL to the Quantum Fisher information in
the short-time regime. This result gives a fundamental trade-off between the
distinguishability between speed and estimation precision, and clarifies how
decoherence can both accelerate and constrain information acquisition.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子计算中的多量子比特控制操作提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a protocol for realizing a Toffoli gate using neutral-atom qubits
in optical tweezers. Two ground-state hyperfine levels of the atoms are
considered as qubit states. Our method relies on the strong and long-range
interactions between atoms due to Rydberg excitations and the occurrence of
dark states in the target qubit, with both control and target qubits being
individually addressed with laser pulses. Our gate protocol enables precise
control over the quantum states of individual qubits, effectively suppressing
undesirable transitions to ensure high-fidelity gate performance. The gate
fidelity is estimated to be about $96\%$ for realistic system parameters. We
further demonstrate a C$^\text{n}$NOT gate with $n >2$ by exploiting the
Rydberg antiblockade mechanism, which allows multiple atoms within the blockade
radius to be simultaneously excited to the Rydberg states. Thus, our approach
may open a promising route to multi-qubit controlled operations for quantum
computation.

Method: 通过通道作用于纯态的副本，将α-Stabilizer Rényi熵编码到纯度中，并利用现有纯度测量算法实现测量。

Result: 算法适用于所有整数α>1，并在量子比特上进行了基准测试，资源需求优于其他已知算法。

Conclusion: 该算法不仅高效测量非稳定性，还揭示了非稳定性与纠缠之间的新关系。

Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, or magic, is a resource for universal quantum computation
in most fault-tolerant architectures; access to states with non-stabilizerness
allows for non-classically simulable quantum computation to be performed.
Quantifying this resource for unknown states is therefore essential to
assessing their utility in quantum computation. The Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies have emerged as a leading tools for achieving this, having already
enabled one efficient algorithm for measuring non-stabilizerness. In addition,
the Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies have proven useful in developing connections
between non-stabilizerness and other quantum phenomena. In this work, we
introduced an alternative algorithm for measuring the Stabilizer R\'enyi
Entropies of an unknown quantum state. Firstly, we show the existence of a
state, produced from the action of a channel on $\alpha$ copies of some pure
state, that encodes the $\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy into its purity. We
detail several methods of applying this channel and then, by employing existing
purity-measuring algorithms, provide an algorithm for measuring the
$\alpha$-Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropies for all integers $\alpha>1$. This
algorithm is benchmarked for qubits and the resource requirements compared to
other known algorithms. Finally, a non-stabilizerness/entanglement relationship
is shown to exist in the algorithm, demonstrating an novel relationship between
the two resources.

Result: 改进的GST能够更准确地捕捉噪声特性，同时降低采样成本。

Conclusion: 研究为开发上下文感知的GST提供了新思路，可能适用于其他量子计算平台。

Abstract: To progress in the characterization of noise for current quantum computers,
gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a self-consistent tomographic protocol
that can accurately estimate the complete set of noisy quantum gates, state
preparations, and measurements. In its original incarnation, GST improves the
estimation precision by applying the gates sequentially, provided that the
noise makes them a set of fixed completely-positive and trace preserving (CPTP)
maps independent of the history of previous gates in the sequence. This
'Markovian' assumption is sometimes in conflict with experimental evidence, as
there might be time-correlated noise leading to non-Markovian dynamics or,
alternatively, slow drifts and cumulative calibration errors that lead to
context dependence, such that the CP-divisible maps composed during a sequence
actually change with the circuit depth. In this work, we address this issue for
trapped-ion devices with phonon-mediated two-qubit gates. By a detailed
microscopic modeling of high-fidelity light-shift gates, we tailor GST to
capture the main source of context dependence: motional degrees of freedom.
Rather than invalidating GST, we show that context dependence can be
incorporated in the parametrization of the gate set, allowing us to reduce the
sampling cost of GST. Our results identify a promising research avenue that
might be applicable to other platforms where microscopic modeling can be
incorporated: the development of a context-aware GST.

Conclusion: 结果为量子系统中非马尔可夫退相干的作用提供了新见解，并为建模量子过程的近似方法提供了基准。

Abstract: Steady-state coherence in open quantum systems is crucial for quantum
technologies, yet its behavior is not fully understood due to the interplay
between collective and individual decoherence. While collective decoherence is
thought to induce steady-state coherence, experiments often fail to observe
this because of individual decoherence. We study a system of two harmonic
oscillators coupled to both individual and collective environments, introducing
a tunable parameter to adjust the decoherence proportions. By analytically
solving the exact dynamical equations, we find that steady-state coherence
depends on the initial state under collective decoherence, but not under
partial decoherence. Interestingly, non-Markovianity induces rich and complex
steady-state coherence behaviors. Our results offer new insights into the role
of non-Markovian decoherence in quantum systems and serve as a benchmark for
evaluating approximate methods in modelling quantum processes.

This paper offers a concise tutorial on fundamental concepts in quantum

restriction of the initial state, where the state of all the sites are the same
except for a single site. We show this version of the problem is also
undecidable (RE-complete). Then we turn to the case where the lattice size is
finite: depening on the defitiniton of the input size, this version of problem
is either EXPSPACE-complete or PSPACE-complete.

Conclusion: 需要开发新的量子访问控制模型以应对量子计算带来的安全威胁。

Abstract: Access control is a cornerstone of computer security that prevents
unauthorised access to resources. In this paper, we study access control in
quantum computer systems. We present the first explicit scenario of a security
breach when a classically secure access control system is straightforwardly
adapted to the quantum setting. The breach is ultimately due to that quantum
mechanics allows the phenomenon of entanglement and violates Mermin inequality,
a multi-party variant of the celebrated Bell inequality. This reveals a threat
from quantum entanglement to access control if existing computer systems
integrate with quantum computing. To protect against such threat, we propose
several new models of quantum access control, and rigorously analyse their
security, flexibility and efficiency.

Result: 第一激发态分布低至(1.2±5.5)×10^-5，有效温度为25.2 mK，优于超导电路的结果。

Conclusion: HBAR是量子态初始化和基础物理研究的有效工具。

Abstract: Initialization of mechanical modes in the quantum ground state is crucial for
their use in quantum information and quantum sensing protocols. In quantum
processors, impurity of the modes' initial state affects the infidelity of
subsequent quantum algorithms. In quantum sensors, excitations out of the
ground state contribute to the noise of the detector, and their prevalence puts
a bound on rare events that deposit energy into the mechanical modes. In this
work, we measure the excited-state populations of GHz-frequency modes in a
high-overtone bulk acoustic wave resonator (HBAR). We find that the population
of the first excited state can be as low as $P_p$=(1.2$\pm$5.5)$\times10^{-5}$,
corresponding to an effective temperature of 25.2 mK, which are upper bounds
limited by imperfections in the measurement process. These results compare
favorably to the lowest populations measured in superconducting circuits.
Finally, we use the measured populations to constrain the amplitude of
high-frequency gravitational waves, the kinetic mixing strength of ultra-light
dark matter, and non-linear modifications of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation
describing wavefunction collapse mechanisms. Our work establishes HBARs as a
versatile resource for quantum state initialization and studies of fundamental
physics.

Conclusion: 量子白化技术不仅加速未知频率搜索，还可用于无先验信息的参数传感。

Abstract: Searching for a weak signal at an unknown frequency is a canonical task in
experiments probing fundamental physics such as gravitational-wave
observatories and ultra-light dark matter haloscopes. These state-of-the-art
sensors are limited by quantum noise arising from the fundamental uncertainty
about the state of the device. Classically, frequency estimation suffers from a
threshold effect in the signal-to-noise ratio such that weak signals are
extremely hard to localise in frequency. We show that this phenomenon persists
at the fundamental quantum limit but that the classical approach, a quadrature
measurement, can nevertheless be beaten by a coherent protocol of projecting
onto the "quantum whitened" possible quantum states. Quantum whitening is a
covariant measurement, and we examine it analytically in the wide-prior limit
and numerically for finite-width priors. Beyond accelerating searches for
unknown frequencies, quantum whitening may be used generally to sense the
parameter of a unitary encoding given no prior information about the parameter.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在实现k-design时电路深度和资源消耗较高，本文旨在通过结合Clifford电路和魔法门来优化这些参数。

Method: 使用浅层Clifford电路前后加入恒定深度的魔法门电路，生成近似的酉和状态k-design。

Result: 在N量子比特上，电路总深度为O(log(N/ε)) + 2^O(k log k)（一维）或O(log log(N/ε)) + 2^O(k log k)（全连接），优于之前结果。

Conclusion: 该方法显著减少了实现k-design所需的电路深度和魔法门数量，并通过统计力学模型验证了其有效性。

Abstract: We introduce magic-augmented Clifford circuits -- architectures in which
Clifford circuits are preceded and/or followed by constant-depth circuits of
non-Clifford (``magic") gates -- as a resource-efficient way to realize
approximate $k$-designs, with reduced circuit depth and usage of magic. We
prove that shallow Clifford circuits, when augmented with constant-depth
circuits of magic gates, can generate approximate unitary and state $k$-designs
with $\epsilon$ relative error. The total circuit depth for these constructions
on $N$ qubits is $O(\log (N/\epsilon)) +2^{O(k\log k)}$ in one dimension and
$O(\log\log(N/\epsilon))+2^{O(k\log k)}$ in all-to-all circuits using ancillas,
which improves upon previous results for small $k \geq 4$. Furthermore, our
construction of relative-error state $k$-designs only involves states with
strictly local magic. The required number of magic gates is parametrically
reduced when considering $k$-designs with bounded additive error. As an
example, we show that shallow Clifford circuits followed by $O(k^2)$
single-qubit magic gates, independent of system size, can generate an
additive-error state $k$-design. We develop a classical statistical mechanics
description of our random circuit architectures, which provides a quantitative
understanding of the required depth and number of magic gates for
additive-error state $k$-designs. We also prove no-go theorems for various
architectures to generate designs with bounded relative error.

Abstract: Presence of harmful noise is inevitable in entanglement-enhanced sensing
systems, requiring careful allocation of resources to optimize sensing
performance in practical scenarios. We advocate a simple but effective strategy
to improve sensing performance in the presence of noise. Given a fixed number
of quantum sensors, we partition the preparation of GHZ states by preparing
smaller, independent sub-ensembles of GHZ states instead of a GHZ state across
all sensors. We perform extensive analytical studies of the phase estimation
performance when using partitioned GHZ states under realistic noise --
including state preparation error, particle loss during parameter encoding, and
sensor dephasing during parameter encoding. We derive simple, closed-form
expressions that quantify the optimal number of sub-ensembles for partitioned
GHZ states. We also examine the explicit noisy quantum sensing dynamics under
dephasing and loss, where we demonstrate the advantage from partitioning for
maximal QFI, short-time QFI increase, and the sensing performance in the
sequential scheme. The results offer quantitative insights into the sensing
performance impact of different noise sources and reinforce the importance of
resource allocation optimization in realistic quantum applications.

Conclusion: LCQNN为量子资源提供了一种新颖框架，既保持可训练性又具备足够表达能力，适用于挑战性机器学习任务。

Abstract: Quantum neural networks combine quantum computing with advanced data-driven
methods, offering promising applications in quantum machine learning. However,
the optimal paradigm of quantum neural networks in the context trainability and
expressivity remains an open question. To overcome this issue, we first
introduce a framework called Linear Combination of Quantum Neural Networks
(LCQNN), which leverages the linear combination of unitaries concept to
coordinate the composition of QNNs, thereby balancing trainability and
expressivity. Secondly, LCQNN provides a tunable design that can reduce
vanishing gradients without incurring excessive classical simulability.
Specifically, we detail how restricting certain subspaces or adopting $k$-local
control unitaries prevents gradients from collapsing while maintaining enough
parameter volume for complex tasks. These findings also align with prior
discussions on expanding QNN capabilities for multi-qubit systems.
Additionally, we extend the LCQNN to the group action scenarios. By exploiting
symmetry, the LCQNN model, excluding exponentially large irreducible subspaces,
can circumvent barren plateaus. Overall, LCQNN provides a novel framework for
focusing quantum resources into architectures that remain practically trainable
yet expressive enough to tackle challenging machine-learning applications.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SN方程在标准薛定谔方程中引入了非线性自引力项，但其预测的微小偏差难以通过实验验证。

Method: 通过周期性调制悬浮机械振荡器的捕获频率，增强SN效应对二阶矩动力学的影响。

Result: 在特定条件下，SN效应被放大了六个数量级，且该方法在当前磁悬浮技术中可行。

Conclusion: 该方法为实验验证SN方程提供了新途径，有助于探索量子力学与引力的界面。

Abstract: The Schr\"odinger-Newton (SN) equation introduces a nonlinear
self-gravitational term to the standard Schr\"odinger equation, offering a
paradigmatic model for semiclassical gravity. However, the small deviations it
predicts from standard quantum mechanics pose significant experimental
challenges. We propose a novel method to amplify such deviations through
periodic modulation of the trapping frequency in a levitated mechanical
oscillator. We identify specific regimes where the SN-induced effects on the
dynamics of second moments are significantly enhanced-by up to six orders of
magnitude compared to unmodulated setups. We show that this protocol remains
feasible within current magnetic levitation technologies and enables
distinguishability between standard and SN dynamics using measurable quantities
such as the position variance. Our results pave the way for a viable
experimental test of the SN equation, offering a new route to probe the
interface between quantum mechanics and gravity.

Conclusion: 子系统层析方法具有实际优势，验证了理论结果。

Abstract: We present a three-qubit quantum state tomography scheme requiring a set of
17 measurements, significantly reducing the experimental overhead compared to
the conventional 63 Pauli measurements. Using IBM's 127-qubit open-access
quantum processor ibm osaka, we prepare the three-qubit W state and employ our
tomography scheme to reconstruct it. Additionally, we implement a two-qubit
tomography protocol, involving a set of 7 measurements, on ibm osaka to
reconstruct two of the two-qubit marginals of the W state. This serves as a
proof-of-principle demonstration of the well-known theoretical result that any
two of the two-qubit reduced density matrices can uniquely determine most of
the whole three-qubit pure states. We show that the fidelity of the W-state
reconstructed from its two-qubit subsystems is consistently larger than that
obtained from the full three-qubit tomography, highlighting the practical
advantage of the subsystem-based tomography approach.

Abstract: How are the spatial and temporal patterns of information scrambling in
locally interacting quantum many-body systems imprinted on the eigenstates of
the system's time-evolution operator? We address this question by identifying
statistical correlations among sets of minimally four eigenstates that provide
a unified framework for various measures of information scrambling. These
include operator mutual information and operator entanglement entropy of the
time-evolution operator, as well as more conventional diagnostics such as
two-point dynamical correlations and out-of-time-ordered correlators. We
demonstrate this framework by deriving exact results for eigenstate
correlations in a minimal model of quantum chaos -- Floquet dual-unitary
circuits. These results reveal not only the butterfly effect and the
information lightcone, but also finer structures of scrambling within the
lightcone. Our work thus shows how the eigenstates of a chaotic system can
encode the full spatiotemporal anatomy of quantum chaos, going beyond the
descriptions offered by random matrix theory and the eigenstate thermalisation
hypothesis.
