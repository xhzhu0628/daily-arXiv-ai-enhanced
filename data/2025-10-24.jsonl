This method is\nemployed to numerically solve the ordinary differential equation emerging from\nthe linearization of the associated nonlinear differential equation. In the\nfirst algorithm, we use the matrix exponentiation method (Patel et al., 2018),\nwhile in the second algorithm, we repurpose the quantum spectral method (Childs\net al., 2020). Our main technical contribution is to derive the sufficient\nconditions for the diagonalization of the Carleman embedding matrix, which is\nindispensable for designing both quantum algorithms. We supplement this with an\nefficient iterative algorithm to diagonalize the Carleman matrix.\n  Our first algorithm has gate complexity of\nO(d$\\cdot$log(d)+T$\\cdot$polylog(T/$\\varepsilon$)). Here $d$ is the size of the\nCarleman matrix, $T$ is the simulation time, and $\\varepsilon$ is the\napproximation error.

In terms of $T$ and\n$\\varepsilon$, this is comparable to the speedup gained by the current best\nknown quantum algorithm for this problem, the truncated Taylor series method\n(Costa et.al., 2025).\n  Our approach has two shortcomings.

Here, we demonstrate the first multiplexing-enhanced\nheralded entanglement between two trapped-ion quantum network nodes. By\nmultiplexing $10$ temporal photonic modes, we achieve a 4.59-fold speedup in\nion-ion entanglement generation and attain an entanglement fidelity of\n$95.9\\pm1.5\\%$ over $1.2$ km of fiber.

In this work, we experimentally investigate the dynamics of a\ntrapped ion where the Rabi frequency (Omega) approaches the vibrational mode\nfrequency (nu), pushing the system beyond the weak-field regime, where\nnon-trivial quantum correlations emerge. We begin by setting the detuning\n(delta) - the frequency offset between the qubit transition and the driving\nfield - to zero and varying Omega from low to high values, eventually reaching\nthe vibrational frequency. Using quantum state tomography, we reconstruct the\ndensity matrix and track its evolution to assess non-Markovianity, revealing\nsignificant memory effects governed by the interplay between internal and\nmotional degrees of freedom.

We\nderive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the\nsuperfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental\nmeasurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very\nhigh sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future\nJosephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate.\nAssuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise\nspectral density of $5\\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK,\nwhich is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one\nsecond of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4\nByrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of\nproper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s."}

Comments welcome", "summary": "The problem of quantum state classification asks how accurately one can\nidentify an unknown quantum state that is promised to be drawn from a known set\nof pure states. In this work, we introduce the notion of $k$-learnability,\nwhich captures the ability to identify the correct state using at most $k$\nguesses, with zero error. We show that deciding whether a given family of\nstates is $k$-learnable can be solved via semidefinite programming. When there\nare $n$ states, we present polynomial-time (in $n$) algorithms for determining\n$k$-learnability for two cases: when $k$ is a fixed constant or the dimension\nof the states is a fixed constant. When both $k$ and the dimension of the\nstates are part of the input, we prove that there exist succinct certificates\nplacing the problem in NP, and we establish NP-hardness by a reduction from the\nclassical $k$-clique problem. Together, our findings delineate the boundary\nbetween efficiently solvable and intractable instances of quantum state\nclassification in the perfect (zero-error) regime."}

In our method, feature\nrelevance-measured via mutual information with the target-is encoded as local\ndetuning amplitudes, while feature redundancy is embedded through\ndistance-dependent van der Waals interactions, constrained by the Rydberg\nblockade radius. The system is evolved adiabatically toward low-energy\nconfigurations, and the resulting measurement bitstrings are used to extract\nphysically consistent subsets of features. The protocol is evaluated through\nsimulations on three benchmark binary classification datasets: Adult Income,\nBank Marketing, and Telco Churn. Compared to classical methods such as mutual\ninformation ranking and Boruta, combined with XGBoost and Random Forest\nclassifiers, our quantum-computing approach achieves competitive or superior\nperformance. In particular, for compact subsets of 2-5 features, analog QFS\nimproves mean AUC scores by 1.5-2.3% while reducing the number of features by\n75-84%, offering interpretable, low-redundancy solutions. These results\ndemonstrate that programmable Rydberg arrays offer a viable platform for\nintelligent feature selection with practical relevance in machine learning\npipelines, capable of transforming computational quantum advantage into\nindustrial quantum usefulness."}
