The present work undertakes to investigate the issue of reality, treading a more fundamental route from the Hamilton-Jacobi equation of classical mechanics to the Schrodinger equation of quantum mechanics. Motivation for this is a similar approach from the eikonal equation in geometrical optics to the wave equation in electromagnetic theory. We rewrite the classical Hamilton-Jacobi equation as a wave equation and seek to generalise de Broglie's wave particle duality by demanding that both particle and light waves have the freedom of being described by any square-integrable function. This generalisation, which allows superposition also for matter wave functions, helps us to obtain the Schrodinger equation, whose solution can be seen to be as much objective as the classical mechanics wave function. Several other equations which one writes in quantum mechanics, including the eigenvalue equations for observables, series expansion of energy states in terms of eigenstates of observables other than energy, etc., can be written in the classical case too. Absence of any collapse of the wave function, entanglement, etc. in the classical realm have their origin in the nonlinearity of the classical wave equation. These considerations indicate that many of the puzzles in quantum mechanics are present also in classical mechanics in a dormant form, which fact shall help to demystify quantum mechanics to a great extent."}

While recent experiments have revealed the continuous nature of individual jumps, the crossover from coherent dynamics to measurement-dominated behaviour has remained elusive. Here, we tune the measurement strength of a continuously monitored superconducting qubit, and observe that quantum jumps emerge not through a gradual crossover, but via a cascade of three distinct dynamical transitions. The first transition manifests as an exceptional point where coherent oscillations abruptly cease, giving way to jumps towards a stable eigenstate. The second transition marks the onset of dynamical state freezing, where the qubit's dwell time near the eigenstate diverges. A third threshold signals entry into the quantum Zeno regime, where stronger measurement paradoxically suppresses relaxation. Strikingly, we find that decoherence does not blur these transitions but rather fundamentally restructures the dynamical phase diagram, notably inverting their order. These results map measurement-induced transitions in a monitored qubit, revealing that the interplay between coherent driving, measurement, and decoherence gives rise to a hierarchy of distinct dynamical phases."}

We ask whether a compiler can instead accept simple, structure-aware specifications while providing predictable resource guarantees. We answer this by designing and implementing a quantum state-preparation compiler for regular language states (RLS): uniform superpositions over bitstrings accepted by a regular description, and their complements. Users describe the target state via (i) a finite set of bitstrings, (ii) a regular expression, or (iii) a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), optionally with a complement flag. By translating the input to a DFA, minimizing it, and mapping it to an optimal matrix product state (MPS), the compiler obtains an intermediate representation (IR) that exposes and compresses hidden structure. The efficient DFA representation and minimization offloads expensive linear algebra computation in exchange of simpler automata manipulations. The combination of the regular-language frontend and this IR gives concise specifications not only for RLS but also for their complements that might otherwise require exponentially large state descriptions. This enables state preparation of an RLS or its complement with the same asymptotic resources and compile time. We outline two hardware-aware backends: SeqRLSP, which yields linear-depth, ancilla-free circuits for linear nearest-neighbor architectures via sequential generation, and TreeRLSP, which achieves logarithmic depth on all-to-all connectivity via a tree tensor network. We prove depth and gate-count bounds scaling with the system size and the state's maximal Schmidt rank, and we give explicit compile-time bounds that expose the benefit of our approach. We implement and evaluate the pipeline."}

We show here that this is not always the case. For this purpose, we study the quenched dynamics of a continuously monitored Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, described by the Lindblad formalism, coupled to a thermal environment modeled by another SYK maintained at constant temperature. We find that the combined effect of monitoring and the thermal bath drives the system toward a non-thermal steady state independently of the initial conditions. The corresponding retarded Green's function exhibits two stages of exponential decay, with rates that depend non-monotonously on the thermal bath coupling and the monitoring strength. In the limit of weak coupling, the late time decay of the Green's function, computed analytically, is closely related to that of the thermal bath. Strikingly, we identify a range of parameters in which continuous monitoring, despite being a source of decoherence, induces or enhances quantum chaotic dynamics suppressed by the thermal bath. For instance, in the limit of weak coupling to the thermal bath, the Lyapunov exponent increases sharply when monitoring is turned on. For intermediate values of the thermal bath coupling, the Lyapunov exponent exhibits re-entrant behavior: it vanishes at zero or sufficiently weak monitoring strength, and becomes positive again as the monitoring strength is increased. Our results offer intriguing insights on the mechanisms leading to quantum scrambling which paves the way to its experimental control and consequently to a performance enhancement of quantum information devices."}

In molecular spin systems, chemical tunability and atomic-scale resolution are accompanied by a dense, thermally accessible phonon spectrum that introduces efficient spin relaxation pathways. Despite extensive theoretical work, there is little experimental consensus on which vibrational energies dominate spin relaxation or how molecular structure controls spin-phonon coupling (SPC). We present a fully experimental method to quantify SPC coefficients by combining temperature-dependent vibrational spectra from inelastic neutron scattering with spin relaxation rates measured by electron paramagnetic resonance. We apply this framework to two model S = 1/2 systems, copper(II) phthalocyanine (CuPc) and copper(II) octaethylporphyrin (CuOEP). Two distinct relaxation regimes emerge: below 40 K, weakly coupled lattice modes below $50~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ dominate, whereas above 40 K, optical phonons above ~$185~\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$ become thermally populated and drive relaxation with SPC coefficients nearly three orders of magnitude larger. Structural distortions in CuOEP that break planar symmetry soften the crystal lattice and enhance anharmonic scattering, but also raise the energy of stretching modes at the molecular core where the spins reside. This redistributes vibrational energy toward the molecular periphery and out of plane, ultimately reducing SPC relative to CuPc and enabling room-temperature spin coherence in CuOEP. Although our method does not provide mode-specific SPC coefficients, it quantifies contributions from distinct spectral regions and establishes a broadly applicable, fully experimental link between crystal structure, lattice dynamics, and spin relaxation."}

Ultraviolet excitation dynamics in these networks are typically modeled with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. By extending this approach to a Lindblad master equation that incorporates explicit site geometries and dipole orientations, we track how correlations are generated, routed, and dissipated, while capturing both energy dissipation and information propagation among coupled chromophores. We compare localized injections, fully delocalized preparations, and eigenmode-based initial states. To quantify the emerging quantum-informational structure, we evaluate the $L_1$ norm of coherence, the correlated coherence, and the logarithmic negativity within and between selected chromophore sub-networks. The results reveal a strong dependence of both the direction and persistence of information flow on the type of initial preparation. Superradiant components drive the rapid export of correlations to the environment, whereas subradiant components retain them and slow their leakage. Embedding single tubulin units into larger dimers and spirals reshapes pairwise correlation maps and enables site-selective routing. Scaling to larger ordered lattices strengthens both export and retention channels, whereas static energetic and structural disorder suppresses long-range transport and reduces overall correlation transfer. These findings provide a Lindbladian picture of information flow in cytoskeletal chromophore networks and identify structural and dynamical conditions that transiently preserve nonclassical correlations in microtubules."}

This paper presents a systematic approach to optimizing the Tesseract decoder through low-level performance enhancements. Based on extensive profiling, we implemented four targeted optimization strategies, including the replacement of inefficient data structures, reorganization of memory layouts to improve cache hit rates, and the use of hardware-accelerated bit-wise operations.

Superconducting qubits are commonly realized using Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$/Al Josephson junctions operating in the tunneling regime, where even minor variations in device geometry can lead to substantial performance fluctuations. In this work, we develop a quantitative model for the variability of the Josephson energy $E_{J}$ induced by interface roughness at the Al/AlO$_{\\text{x}}$ interfaces. The roughness is modeled as a Gaussian random field characterized by two parameters: the root-mean-square roughness amplitude $σ$ and the transverse correlation length $ξ$. These parameters are extracted from the literature and molecular dynamics simulations. Quantum transport is treated using the Ambegaokar--Baratoff relation combined with a local thickness approximation. Numerical simulations over $5,000$ Josephson junctions show that $E_{J}$ follows a log-normal distribution. The mean value of $E_{J}$ increases with $σ$ and decreases slightly with $ξ$, while the variance of $E_{J}$ increases with both $σ$ and $ξ$. These results paint a quantitative and intuitive picture of Josephson energy variability induced by surface roughness, with direct relevance for junction design."}

The SHE operates in two steps: first, in the work extraction stage, heat from a thermal energy reservoir is converted into optical work via a two photon Raman transition resonant with close-to energy degenerate spin states; second, the internal spin states are brought back to their initial state via non-energetic information erasure using a spin reservoir. The latter incurs no energy cost, but rather the reset occurs at the cost of angular momentum from a spin bath that acts as the thermal spin reservoir. The SHE represents an important first step toward demonstrating heat engines that operate beyond the conventional paradigm of requiring two thermal reservoirs, paving the way to harness quantum coherence in arbitrary conserved quantities via similar machines."}

This is a critical review that summarizes the current applications of quantum annealing to combinatorial optimization and includes a theoretical background, hardware designs, algorithm implementation strategies, encoding and embedding schemes, protocols to benchmark quantum annealing, areas of implementation, and links with the quantum algorithms implementation with gate-based hardware and classical solvers.

While simple and effective, this coupling scheme makes it difficult to satisfy competing circuit design requirements such as maintaining large qubit anharmonicity and coherence along with a high degree of qubit connectivity and packing density. Moreover, tunable interactions using linear coupling elements produce dynamical variations in mode hybridization, which can induce non-adiabatic transitions, resulting in leakage errors and limiting gate speeds. In this work we attempt to address these challenges by proposing a junction-based coupling architecture based on SQUID (superconducting quantum interference device) couplers with relatively small Josephson energies. SQUID couplers provide intrinsic cross-Kerr interactions that can be controlled by external fluxes and that do not rely on mode hybridization. The small Josephson energies of the coupler maintain the interaction at a perturbative scale, which limits undesired higher-order mixing between coupled elements while achieving a sufficiently strong cross-Kerr interaction originating from diagonal coupling elements. Based on these properties, we show that a SQUID coupler can be used to implement a fast, adiabatic, and high-fidelity controlled-Z gate without introducing extra modes, and the operation is robust against junction asymmetry for high-frequency qubits. Although unconventional crosstalk may arise due to junction asymmetries and parasitic hybridization with spectator qubits, we show that these effects are sufficiently small for realistic circuit parameters. As an example of the utility of such junction-based coupling schemes, we present a scalable tiling strategy for a miniaturized superconducting quantum processor based on merged-element transmon qubits."}

Recently, a dissipative diagnostic of chaos has been proposed, in which an infinitesimal coupling to a bath yields a finite Liouvillian gap in chaotic systems, marking the onset of intrinsic relaxation. This raises a conceptual question: what is the minimal departure from Clifford dynamics needed for this intrinsically relaxing behavior to emerge? In this work, we investigate the dynamics under the Floquet two-qubit Clifford circuit interleaved with a finite density of Haar-random single-site gates, followed by a depolarizing channel with strength $γ$. For Floquet Clifford circuits built from an \\textit{i}SWAP-class two-qubit gate, our analysis identifies two distinct regimes for the Liouvillian gap in the thermodynamic limit, exemplified by the undoped and fully doped extreme cases. In both regimes, the dissipative diagnostic signals chaotic behavior, differing only in how the gap scales with system size. In the undoped circuit, the gap scales as $Δ\\sim γN$, whereas in the fully doped circuit it remains finite as $N\\to\\infty$. We find that the doping density $p_h$ governs the crossover: as $p_h\\to 0$, any spatial structure remains undoped-like, whereas for finite $p_h$ certain structures can enter a finite-gap regime. These results are analytically established in the strongly dissipative regime $γ\\gg 1$ by deriving lower bounds on the gap as a function of $p_h$ and explicit finite-gap constructions, and their extension toward $γ\\to 0$ is supported by numerics. Importantly, our analytic treatment depends only on the spatial doping structure, so the same gap scaling persists even when the Haar rotations are independently resampled each Floquet period."}

For example, VQA optimization often suffers from vanishing gradients called barren plateau (BP) and the presence of local minima in the landscape of the cost function. Numerical studies have shown that the trap in local minima is significantly reduced when the circuit is overparametrized (OP), where the number of parameters exceeds a certain threshold. Theoretical understanding of the BP and OP phenomena has advanced over the past years, however, comprehensive studies of both effects in the same setting are not fully covered in the literature. In this paper, we perform a comprehensive numerical study in VQA, quantitatively evaluating the impacts of BP and OP and their interplay on the optimization of a variational quantum circuit, using concrete implementations of one-dimensional transverse and longitudinal field quantum Ising model. The numerical results are compared with the theoretical diagnostics of BP and OP phenomena. The framework presented in this paper will provide a guiding principle for designing VQA algorithms and ansatzes with theoretical support for behaviors of parameter optimization in practical settings."}

A recent paper by Meister et al. [arXiv:2405.07433 (2024)] proposed an efficient method to evaluate soft outputs for cluster-based decoders, including the Union-Find (UF) decoder. However, in parallel computing environments, its computational complexity is comparable to or even surpasses that of the UF decoder itself, resulting in a substantial overhead. Furthermore, this method requires global information about the decoding graph, making it poorly suited for existing hardware implementations of the UF decoder on Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). In this paper, to alleviate these issues, we develop more efficient methods for evaluating high-quality soft outputs in cluster-based decoders by introducing several early-stopping techniques. Our central idea is that the precise value of a large soft output is often unnecessary in practice. Based on this insight, we introduce two types of novel soft-outputs: the bounded cluster gap and the extra-cluster gap. The former reduces the computational complexity of Meister's method by terminating the calculation at an early stage. Our numerical simulations show that this method achieves improved scaling with code distance $d$ compared to the original proposal. The latter, the extra-cluster gap, quantifies decoder reliability by performing a small, additional growth of the clusters obtained by the decoder. This approach offers the significant advantage of enabling soft-output computation without modifying the existing architecture of FPGA-implemented UF decoders. These techniques offer lower computational complexity and higher hardware compatibility, laying a crucial foundation for future real-time decoders with soft outputs."}

We characterize analytically the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian in terms of a spectral function, and numerically compute the Zak phase to probe the bulk topological content of the insulating phases. Our findings reveal that, while the Zak phase is quantized in classes AIII and BDI, it exhibits non-quantized values in class D, challenging its traditional role as a topological marker in continuum settings. We also discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence for a truncated version of the chain, analyzing how the emergence of edge states depends on both the truncation position and the boundary conditions. In classes AIII and BDI, we find that the Zak phase effectively detects edge states as a relative boundary topological index, although the correspondence is highly sensitive to the parameters characterizing the truncation."}

Here, we cast quantum circuit synthesis as a closed-loop, test-time optimization problem: an LLM proposes edits to a fixed-length gate list, and an external simulator evaluates the resulting state with the Meyer-Wallach (MW) global entanglement measure. We introduce a lightweight test-time learning recipe that can reuse prior high-performing candidates as an explicit memory trace, augments prompts with a score-difference feedback, and applies restart-from-the-best sampling to escape potential plateaus. Across fixed 20-qubit settings, the loop without feedback and restart-from-the-best improves random initial circuits over a range of gate budgets. To lift up this performance and success rate, we use the full learning strategy. For 25-qubit, it mitigates a pronounced performance plateau when naive querying is used. Beyond raw scores, we analyze the structure of synthesized states and find that high MW solutions can correspond to stabilizer or graph-state-like constructions, but full connectivity is not guaranteed due to the metric property and prompt design.

Applying the rotating wave approximation (RWA) to the system-bath interaction Hamiltonian, we derive a completely positive Born-Markov master equation for the reduced dynamics. We express the resulting master equation in the coordinate representation and, utilizing the adiabatic elimination of fast variables, derive a completely positive hybrid quantum-classical master equation that defines OQBM. We illustrate the resulting dynamics using examples of initial Gaussian and non-Gaussian distributions of the OQBM walker. Both examples reveal the emergence of Gaussian distributions in the limiting behavior of the OQBM dynamics, which closely matches that of the standard OQBM. With the help of the obtained OQBM master equation, we derive the equations for the $n$-th moments and the cumulants of the position distribution of the open Brownian walker. We subsequently solve these equations numerically for Gaussian initial distributions across various parameter regimes.

We first review their basic properties, including closure under tensor contraction and certain quantum operations. We show that quantum states with Lee-Yang radius $r > 1$ can be prepared by quasipolynomial-sized circuits.

By minimizing geometric action, LAUT guarantees dynamical fidelity and inherently enforces the preservation of symmetries--properties frequently violated by conventional Schrieffer-Wolff and Givens rotation techniques. We identify the Bloch-Brandow formalism as the natural perturbative counterpart to this principle, yielding analytic expansions that preserve symmetries to high order. We validate this framework against experimental data from superconducting quantum processors, demonstrating that LAUT quantitatively reproduces interaction rates in driven entangling gates where standard approximations diverge. Furthermore, in tunable coupler architectures, we demonstrate that the LAUT approach captures essential non-rotating-wave contributions that standard models neglect; this inclusion is critical for quantitatively reproducing interaction rates and revealing physical multi-body interactions such as $XZX+YZY$, which are verified to be physical rather than gauge artifacts.

Traditionally, this enhancement is associated with a closing energy gap, which causes the characteristic timescales for adiabatic preparation or relaxation to diverge with increasing system size. Consequently, the apparent growth of the quantum Fisher information largely reflects the increasing evolution time induced by critical slowing down, rather than a genuine gain in metrological performance, thereby severely limiting the practical usefulness of such protocols. Here we show that the relationship between energy-gap variations, quantum Fisher information, and achievable precision is far more subtle in interacting quantum systems: enhanced sensitivity does not require a vanishing gap, and, perhaps more surprisingly, a decreasing quantum Fisher information does not necessarily imply reduced precision once the time is properly taken into account. Building on this insight, we introduce an anti-critical metrology scheme that achieves enhanced precision while the energy gap increases. We illustrate this mechanism using the quantum Rabi model, thereby identifying a route to metrological advantage that avoids the critical slowing down associated with conventional criticality."}

While quantum algorithms are known to offer quadratic speedups over classical Monte Carlo methods, end-to-end speedups have been proven only in the simplified setting over the Black-Scholes geometric Brownian motion (GBM) model. This paper extends existing frameworks to demonstrate novel quadratic speedups for more practical models, such as the Cox-Ingersoll-Ross (CIR) model and a variant of Heston's stochastic volatility model, utilizing a characteristic of the underlying SDEs which we term fast-forwardability. Additionally, for general models that do not possess the fast-forwardable property, we introduce a quantum Milstein sampler, based on a novel quantum algorithm for sampling Lévy areas, which enables quantum multi-level Monte Carlo to achieve quadratic speedups for multi-dimensional stochastic processes exhibiting certain correlation types.\n  We also present an improved analysis of numerical integration for derivative pricing, leading to substantial reductions in the resource requirements for pricing GBM and CIR models. Furthermore, we investigate the potential for additional reductions using arithmetic-free quantum procedures.

Most existing approaches target phase estimation and rely on a shared phase reference between the signal and the probe, yet many relevant scenarios deal with regimes where such a reference is absent, making the estimation of force or field amplitudes the main task. We study this phase-insensitive regime for bosonic sensors that undergo identical displacements with common phases randomly varying between experimental runs. We derive analytical bounds on the achievable precision and show that it is determined by first-order normal correlations between modes in the probe state, constrained by their average excitations. These correlations yield a collective sensitivity enhancement over the standard quantum limit, with a gain that grows linearly in the total excitation number, revealing a distributed quantum advantage even without a global phase reference. We identify families of multimode states with definite joint parity that saturate this limit and can be probed efficiently via local parity measurements already demonstrated or emerging in several quantum platforms. We further demonstrate that experimentally relevant decoherence channels favor two distinct sensing strategies: splitting of a single-mode nonclassical state among the modes, which is robust to loss and heating, and separable probes, which are instead resilient to dephasing and phase jitter. Our results are relevant to multimode continuous platforms, including trapped-ion, solid-state mechanical, optomechanical, superconducting, and photonic systems."}

However, passive reset occurs on timescales that are much longer than those of gate operations and measurements, making it a significant bottleneck for algorithmic execution. Here, we show that this limitation can be overcome by exploiting the Mpemba effect, originally indicating the faster cooling of hot systems compared to cooler ones. Focusing on the regime where coherence times exceed energy relaxation times ($T_2 > T_1$), we propose a simple protocol based on a single entangling two-qubit gate that converts local single-qubit coherences into fast-decaying global two-qubit coherences. This removes their overlap with the slowest decaying Liouvillian mode and enables a substantially faster relaxation to the ground state. For realistic parameters, we find that our protocol can reduce reset times by up to $50\\%$ compared to standard passive reset. We analyze the robustness of the protocol under non-Markovian noise, imperfect coherent control and finite temperature, finding that the accelerated reset persists across a broad range of realistic error sources. Finally, we present an experimental implementation of our protocol on an IQM superconducting quantum processor. Our results demonstrate how Mpemba-like accelerated relaxation can be harnessed as a practical tool for fast and accurate qubit initialization."}
