In the homogeneous\n(random translation-invariant) case, for any error tolerance in probability,\nthe two-point function decays exponentially in the distance between the two\nsites, with a deterministic rate. In the i.i.d. case, the exponential decay\nstill holds with a deterministic rate, with the probability approaching one\nexponentially fast in the distance. For strictly stationary ensembles with\ndecaying spatial dependence, the correlation decay quantitatively reflects the\nmixing profile: ($\\rho$)-mixing yields polynomial bounds with high probability,\nwhile stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay in ($\\rho$) (resp.\n($\\beta$)) yields stretched-exponential (resp. exponential) decay of the\ntwo-point function, again with correspondingly strong high-probability\nguarantees. Altogether, the framework unifies and extends recent progress on\nstationary ergodic and Gaussian translation-invariant ensembles, providing a\ntransfer-operator route to typical correlation decay in random MPS."}

To understand entanglement in such systems, we use a\nframework in which subsystems are described by von Neumann algebras on the full\nsystem's Hilbert space. Although this approach has been known for over 50\nyears, an operational justification has been missing so far. We resolve this by\nderiving the von Neumann algebraic description of subsystems from operational\naxioms. This raises the question of how physical properties of the subsystem\nrelate to algebraic properties. Our main result shows a surprisingly strong\nconnection: The type classification of von Neumann algebras (types I, II, III,\nand their respective subtypes) is in one-to-one correspondence with a family of\noperational entanglement properties. For instance, Connes' classification of\ntype III factors can be formulated in terms of the smallest achievable error\nwhen \"embezzling\" entanglement from the system. Our findings promote the type\nclassification from algebraic bookkeeping to a classification of infinite\nquantum systems based on the kind of infinite entanglement that they support."}

We further reveal the advantages of\nour scheme using a higher-order probe beam and balanced homodyne detection by\nmeans of quantum and classical Fisher information. The real-time and\nhigh-precision measurement of the YIG sphere's deformation in 3Ds can be used\nto determinate specific mechanical modes, characterize the magnomechanical\ndynamical backaction and the 3D cooling of the mechanical vibration, and thus\nfinds a wide range of applications in magnomechanics."}

A central\nchallenge is to construct unitary $k$-designs that closely approximate\nHaar-random unitaries while minimizing the costly use of non-Clifford\noperations. In this work, we present a protocol, named Quantum Homeopathy, able\nto generate unitary $k$-designs on $n$ qubits, secure against any adversarial\nquantum measurement, with a system-size-independent number of non-Clifford\ngates. Inspired by the principle of homeopathy, our method applies a $k$-design\nonly to a subsystem of size $\\Theta(k)$, independent of $n$. This \"seed\" design\nis then \"diluted\" across the entire $n$-qubit system by sandwiching it between\ntwo random Clifford operators. The resulting ensemble forms an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate unitary $k$-design on $n$ qubits. We prove that this\nconstruction achieves full quantum security against adaptive adversaries using\nonly $\\tilde{O}(k^2 \\log\\varepsilon^{-1})$ non-Clifford gates. If one requires\nsecurity only against polynomial-time adaptive adversaries, the non-Clifford\ncost decreases to $\\tilde{O}(k + \\log^{1+c} \\varepsilon^{-1})$. This is\noptimal, since we show that at least $\\Omega(k)$ non-Clifford gates are\nrequired in this setting.
