This linearity encodes the superposition\nprinciple, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break\ndown in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum\nevolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this\nbreakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the\ncircuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective\nnon-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an\nanti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use\nquantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective,\nnonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a\nsuperposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and\nobserve clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP)\ndegeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density\nmatrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while\ndemonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These\nresults provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum\nevolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical\nnon-Hermitian systems."}

Both\ntheorems show that \"enough\" Wigner negativity -- either a large-enough Wigner\nnegativity volume along a suitably-chosen two-dimensional slice, or a\nlarge-enough nonclassicality depth of the centre-of-mass of a system --\ncertifies the presence of GME. Moreover, violations of the latter inequality\nprovide lower bounds of the trace distance to the set of non-GME states. Our\nresults also provide sufficient conditions for generating GME by interfering a\nstate with the vacuum through a multiport interferometer, complementing\nlong-known necessary conditions. Beyond these fundamental connections, our\nmethods have practical advantages for systems with native phase-space\nmeasurements: they require only measuring the Wigner function over a finite\nregion, or measuring a finite number of characteristic function points. Such\nmeasurements are frequently performed with readouts common in circuit/cavity\nquantum electrodynamic systems, trapped ions and atoms, and circuit quantum\nacoustodynamic systems. As such, our GME criteria are readily implementable in\nthese platforms."}

In\nthis work, we propose methods to implement GME witnesses through phase-space\nmeasurements in state-of-the-art experimental platforms, leveraging controlled\nGaussian unitaries readily available in qubit-CV architectures. Based on two\ntheoretical results showing that sufficient Wigner negativity can certify GME,\nwe present five concrete implementation schemes using controlled parity,\ndisplacement, and beamsplitter operations. Our witnesses can detect\nparadigmatic GME states like the Dicke and multipartite $N00N$ states, which\ninclude the W states as a special case, and GHZ-type entangled cat states. We\nanalyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and\nfinite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental\nimperfections. Crucially, our implementations require exponentially fewer\nmeasurement settings than full tomography, with one scheme requiring only a\nsingle measurement on auxiliary modes. The methods are readily applicable to\ncircuit/cavity quantum electrodynamics, circuit quantum acoustodynamics, as\nwell as trapped ions and atoms systems, where such dichotomic phase-space\nmeasurements are already routinely performed as native readouts."}

The former deterministically\nrealizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources,\nwhereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential\nsampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these\ntwo paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of\nentanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower\nbounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol\ndemonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the\nasymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical\ncommunication. This hybrid approach enhances both sampling and entanglement\nefficiency, enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed\nquantum computation."}

Here, we propose and\ninvestigate two theoretical protocols for fast single-shot readout of\ncavity-coupled single T center electronic spins. For fluorescence-based\nreadout, we selectively couple one of the T center spin-conserving transitions\nto a single-mode photonic cavity, exploiting the enhancement of the\nfluorescence emission and cyclicity. For reflection-based readout, we leverage\nthe spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout\nsignal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin\nreadout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic\nsystem parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\\times10^5$ and T center\noptical linewidth $\\Gamma/2\\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout\nfidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\\mu$s for both spin readout protocols."}
