### [1] [Formal Verification of Variational Quantum Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10635)
*Nicola Assolini,Luca Marzari,Isabella Mastroeni,Alessandra di Pierro*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文首次深入研究了变分量子电路（VQC）的形式验证问题，提出了基于抽象解释的新语义框架，并分析了其复杂性和局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: VQC在量子机器学习中具有重要地位，但其对抗性输入的脆弱性尚未有形式化验证方法，类似于经典深度学习模型。

Method: 采用基于区间的可达性技术，并结合抽象解释方法，定义VQC的验证问题并分析其复杂性。

Result: 研究发现量子特有的状态归一化等问题挑战了现有方法，新框架能有效处理这些问题。

Conclusion: 论文为VQC的形式验证提供了理论基础和实践方法，填补了该领域的空白。

Abstract: Variational quantum circuits (VQCs) are a central component of many quantum
machine learning algorithms, offering a hybrid quantum-classical framework
that, under certain aspects, can be considered similar to classical deep neural
networks. A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial
inputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While
formal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical
models, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs.
Here, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the
formal verification problem for VQCs. Inspired by abstract interpretation
methods used in deep learning, we analyze the applicability and limitations of
interval-based reachability techniques in the quantum setting. We show that
quantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable
dependencies that challenge existing approaches. We investigate these issues by
introducing a novel semantic framework based on abstract interpretation, where
the verification problem for VQCs can be formally defined, and its complexity
analyzed. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on standard verification
benchmarks.

### [2] [Stabilizer Rényi Entropy Encodes Fusion Rules of Topological Defects and Boundaries](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10656)
*Masahiro Hoshino,Yuto Ashida*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 稳定器Rényi熵（SRE）可作为探测一维量子临界系统中共形缺陷的通用性质的信息论工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SRE在共形缺陷中的通用性质，以揭示其作为量子魔力量度的潜力。

Method: 使用边界共形场论分析SRE的通用对数修正和尺寸无关项，并通过数值计算验证。

Result: 边界和拓扑缺陷分别表现为SRE的通用对数修正和尺寸无关项，且SRE能反映缺陷融合规则。

Conclusion: SRE是研究共形缺陷和拓扑缺陷的有效工具，其通用性质与缺陷融合规则一致。

Abstract: We demonstrate that the stabilizer R\'{e}nyi entropy (SRE), a computable
measure of quantum magic, can serve as an information-theoretic probe for
universal properties associated with conformal defects in one-dimensional
quantum critical systems. Using boundary conformal field theory, we show that
open boundaries manifest as a universal logarithmic correction to the SRE,
whereas topological defects yield a universal size-independent term. When
multiple defects are present, we find that the universal terms in the SRE
faithfully reflect the defect-fusion rules that define noninvertible symmetry
algebra. These analytical predictions are corroborated by numerical
calculations of the Ising model, where boundaries and topological defects are
described by Cardy states and Verlinde lines, respectively.

### [3] [Optimal Calibration of Qubit Detuning and Crosstalk](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10661)
*David Shnaiderov,Matan Ben Dov,Yoav Woldiger,Assaf Hamo,Eugene Demler,Emanuele G. Dalla Torre*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过优化Ramsey干涉实验来估计量子比特失谐和串扰参数的方法，显著减少了校准时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子处理器中物理量子比特的校准面临串扰问题，导致单个量子比特失谐估计复杂化。

Method: 利用Fisher信息和Cramer-Rao界优化Ramsey干涉实验，比较了多种校准协议。

Result: 实验验证表明，双正交单时间测量方法在精度和鲁棒性上最优，校准时间减少50%。

Conclusion: 该方法能高效准确地提取参数，适用于孤立和耦合量子比特系统。

Abstract: Characterizing and calibrating physical qubits is essential for maintaining
the performance of quantum processors. A key challenge in this process is the
presence of crosstalk that complicates the estimation of individual qubit
detunings. In this work, we derive optimal strategies for estimating detuning
and crosstalk parameters by optimizing Ramsey interference experiments using
Fisher information and the Cramer-Rao bound. We compare several calibration
protocols, including measurements of a single quadrature at multiple times and
of two quadratures at a single time, for a fixed number of total measurements.
Our results predict that the latter approach yields the highest precision and
robustness in both cases of isolated and coupled qubits. We validate
experimentally our approach using a single NV center as well as superconducting
transmons. Our approach enables accurate parameter extraction with
significantly fewer measurements, resulting in up to a 50\% reduction in
calibration time while maintaining estimation accuracy.

### [4] [Entanglement and Purity in Open Systems: A Breakdown of the Lindblad Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10668)
*Raoul Serao,Aniello Quaranta,Antonio Capolupo,Fabio Franchini,Salvatore Marco Giampaolo*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Lindblad master equation在描述开放量子系统的短时动力学时存在局限性，特别是在纠缠和纯度预测方面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Lindblad主方程在描述开放量子系统中纠缠和纯度短时动力学的有效性。

Method: 比较Lindbladian方法和全微观处理方法，并引入时间依赖的Lindbladian进行改进。

Result: Lindbladian方法预测线性纯度衰减并可能完全抑制纠缠，而全微观处理显示纠缠增长和二次纯度衰减。时间依赖Lindbladian改进部分预测但引入不一致性。

Conclusion: 有效模型在描述微妙量子行为时存在局限性，需谨慎应用。

Abstract: We examine the effectiveness of Lindblad master equation in capturing the
short-time dynamics of entanglement and purity in open quantum systems.
Focusing on two interacting two-level systems interacting with a larger
environment, we compare the Lindbladian approach to a full microscopic
treatment. While the latter shows entanglement growth and a quadratic decay of
purity, the Lindbladian method predicts a linear purity decay and can entirely
suppress entanglement when the dissipative coupling exceeds the interaction
strength. Introducing a time-dependent Lindbladian improves some predictions
but causes inconsistencies in other observables. Our results highlight the
limitations of effective models and the need for caution when applying them to
describe subtle quantum behaviors.

### [5] [Optimal quantum transport on a ring via locally monitored chiral quantum walks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10669)
*Sara Finocchiaro,Giovanni Luilli,Giuliano Benenti,Matteo G. A. Paris,Luca Razzoli*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究通过手性和局部监测优化环形结构中的量子传输效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决纯相干传输中因破坏性干涉导致的传输概率低问题。

Method: 采用局部监测的连续时间手性量子行走模型，结合时间反演对称性破坏和测量频率优化。

Result: 通过分析Perron-Frobenius算子的光谱特性，确定了最大化检测概率的最佳条件。

Conclusion: 提供了一种增强监测系统中量子传输的通用框架。

Abstract: In purely coherent transport on finite networks, destructive interference can
significantly suppress transfer probabilities, which can only reach high values
through careful fine-tuning of the evolution time or tailored initial-state
preparations. We address this issue by investigating excitation transfer on a
ring, modeling it as a locally monitored continuous-time chiral quantum walk.
Chirality, introduced through time-reversal symmetry breaking, imparts a
directional bias to the coherent dynamics and can lift dark states. Local
monitoring, implemented via stroboscopic projective measurements at the target
site, provides a practical detection protocol without requiring fine-tuning of
the evolution time. By analyzing the interplay between chirality and
measurement frequency, we identify optimal conditions for maximizing the
asymptotic detection probability. The optimization of this transfer protocol
relies on the spectral properties of the Perron-Frobenius operator, which
capture the asymptotic non-unitary dynamics, and on the analysis of dark
states. Our approach offers a general framework for enhancing quantum transport
in monitored systems.

### [6] [Data-insenstive cooling of polar molecules with Rydberg atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10671)
*Jeremy T. Young,Ron Belyansky,Kang-Kuen Ni,Alexey V. Gorshkov*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种利用里德伯原子对极性分子进行冷却的方法，同时保留分子的量子信息。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极性分子在量子计算和模拟中因热运动导致的信息丢失问题。

Result: 实现了极性分子的相干冷却，不影响其内部状态，可重复操作。

Conclusion: 该方法有望延长混合光镊阵列中量子计算和模拟的时间。

Abstract: We propose a method to sympathetically cool polar molecules with Rydberg
atoms without destroying the quantum information encoded in the polar
molecules. While the interactions between the two are usually state-dependent,
we show how to engineer state-insensitive interactions between the hot
molecules and the cold atoms with a suitable choice of internal states and the
application of external fields. The resulting interactions, which may be van
der Waals or dipolar, induce a phonon swap interaction between the two species,
thereby coherently cooling the polar molecules without affecting the internal
state, a process which can be repeated if the atoms are cooled again or new
cold atoms are brought in. Our cooling schemes open the possibility of
extending quantum computation and simulation times in emerging hybrid tweezer
arrays of polar molecules and neutral atoms.

### [7] [Manarat: A Scalable QICK-Based Control System for Superconducting Quantum Processors Supporting Synchronized Control of 10 Flux-Tunable Qubits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10676)
*Agustin Silva,Alvaro Orgaz-Fuertes*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: Manarat是一个基于QICK的可扩展多板控制平台，通过硬件、固件和软件增强实现多板同步，支持超导量子处理器的扩展操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着量子比特数量增加，单控制模块无法满足多量子比特操作的需求，需要一种可扩展的控制架构。

Method: Manarat通过低抖动时钟分配网络、tProcessor修改和同步方案实现多板同步，并集成定制模拟前端用于通量控制。

Result: 在10量子比特超导处理器上验证，实现了亚纳秒级同步和跨板CZ门校准。

Conclusion: Manarat证明了多RFSoC板间的亚纳秒同步和相干控制可行，为超导量子计算机的可扩展操作提供了解决方案。

Abstract: A scalable control architecture for superconducting quantum processors is
essential as the number of qubits increases and coherent multi-qubit operations
span beyond the capacity of a single control module. The Quantum
Instrumentation Control Kit (QICK), built on AMD RFSoC platforms, offers a
flexible open-source framework for pulse-level qubit control but lacks native
support for multi-board synchronization, limiting its applicability to mid- and
large-scale quantum devices. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Manarat,
a scalable multi-board control platform based on QICK that incorporates
hardware, firmware, and software enhancements to enable sub-100 ps timing
alignment across multiple AMD ZCU216 RFSoC boards. Our system integrates a
low-jitter clock distribution network, modifications to the tProcessor, and a
synchronization scheme to ensure deterministic alignment of program execution
across boards. It also includes a custom analog front-end for flux control that
combines high-speed RF signals with software-programmable DC biasing voltages
generated by a low-noise, high-precision DAC. These capabilities are
complemented by a software stack capable of orchestrating synchronized
multi-board experiments and fully integrated with the open-source Qibo
framework for quantum device calibration and algorithm execution. We validate
Manarat on a 10-qubit superconducting processor controlled by two RFSoC boards,
demonstrating reliable execution of synchronized control sequences for
cross-board CZ gate calibration. These results confirm that sub-nanosecond
synchronization and coherent control is achievable across multiple RFSoC
boards, enabling scalable operation of superconducting quantum computers.

### [8] [Magic transition in monitored free fermion dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10688)
*Cheng Wang,Zhi-Cheng Yang,Tianci Zhou,Xiao Chen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 研究了1+1维随机自由费米子电路中魔幻性与纠缠的关系，发现魔幻性结构在相变中发生去局域化转变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索自由费米子动力学中的魔幻性与纠缠相变之间的联系。

Method: 使用稳定子Rényi熵（SRE）量化魔幻性，并通过完美采样算法进行数值计算。

Result: SRE在临界相和面积律相中均保持广延性，但魔幻性结构发生去局域化相变。

Conclusion: 临界相中SRE的弛豫时间随系统尺寸线性增长，进一步证实了该相的临界性质。

Abstract: We investigate magic and its connection to entanglement in 1+1 dimensional
random free fermion circuits, with a focus on hybrid free fermion dynamics that
can exhibit an entanglement phase transition. To quantify magic, we use the
Stabilizer R\'enyi Entropy (SRE), which we compute numerically via a perfect
sampling algorithm. We show that although the SRE remains extensive as the
system transitions from a critical phase to an area-law (disentangled) phase,
the structure of magic itself undergoes a delocalization phase transition. This
transition is characterized using the bipartite stabilizer mutual information,
which exhibits the same scaling behavior as entanglement entropy: logarithmic
scaling in the critical phase and a finite constant in the area-law phase.
Additionally, we explore the dynamics of SRE. While the total SRE becomes
extensive in $O(1)$ time, we find that in the critical phase, the relaxation
time to the steady-state value is parameterically longer than that in generic
random circuits. The relaxation follows a universal form, with a relaxation
time that grows linearly with the system size, providing further evidence for
the critical nature of the phase.

### [9] [Classifying locally distinguishable sets: No activation across bipartitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10698)
*Atanu Bhunia,Saronath Halder,Ritabrata Sengupta*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了局部可区分量子态在特定条件下能否转换为局部不可区分态的问题，并分类了这些态的结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索局部可区分态在正交保持LOCC（OP-LOCC）下转换为局部不可区分态的条件，填补相关研究空白。

Method: 通过分析不同结构的局部可区分态（包括乘积态和纠缠态），确定其是否允许转换，并引入层次分类。

Result: 发现某些局部可区分态可以转换为局部不可区分态，而另一些则不能，并提出了“跨二分区无激活”现象。

Conclusion: 研究为量子态的分类和应用提供了新视角，特别是在多体系统中展示了更复杂的转换行为。

Abstract: A set of orthogonal quantum states is said to be locally indistinguishable if
they cannot be perfectly distinguished by local operations and classical
communication (LOCC). Otherwise, the states are locally distinguishable.
However, locally indistinguishable states may find applications in information
processing protocols. In this sense, locally indistinguishable states are
useful. On the other hand, it is usual to consider that locally distinguishable
states are useless. Nevertheless, recent works suggest that locally
distinguishable states should be given due consideration as in certain
situations these states can be converted to locally indistinguishable states
under orthogonality-preserving LOCC (OP-LOCC). Such a counterintuitive
phenomenon motivates us to ask when the aforesaid conversion is possible and
when it is not. In this work, we provide different structures of locally
distinguishable product and entangled states which do not allow the aforesaid
conversion. We also provide certain structures of locally distinguishable
states which allow the aforesaid conversion. In this way, we classify the
locally distinguishable sets by introducing hierarchies among them. In a
multipartite system, this study becomes more involved as there exist
multipartite locally distinguishable sets which cannot be converted to locally
indistinguishable sets by OP-LOCC across any bipartition. We say this as ``no
activation across bi-partitions".

Result: QCrank在中性原子硬件上表现出良好的精度扩展性，优于其他硬件平台。

Conclusion: 中性原子硬件在量子数据存储方面具有潜力，QCrank方法为其优化部署提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Algorithm and hardware-aware compilation co-design is essential for the
efficient deployment of near-term quantum programs. We present a compilation
case-study implementing QCrank -- an efficient encoding protocol for storing
sequenced real-valued classical data in a quantum state -- targeting neutral
atom-based Dynamically Programmable Qubit Arrays (DPQAs). We show how key
features of neutral-atom arrays such as high qubits count, operation
parallelism, multi-zone architecture, and natively reconfigurable connectivity
can be used to inform effective algorithm deployment. We identify algorithmic
and circuit features that signal opportunities to implement them in a
hardware-efficient manner. To evaluate projected hardware performance, we
define a realistic noise model for DPQAs using parameterized Pauli channels,
implement it in Qiskit circuit simulators, and assess QCrank's accuracy for
writing and reading back 24-320 real numbers into 6-20 qubits. We compare DPQA
results with simulated performances of Quantinuum's H1-1E and with experimental
results from IBM Fez, highlighting promising accuracy scaling for DPQAs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典波原子变换用于构建微分算子的稀疏表示，但量子算法能实现更广泛的变换类别。

Method: 采用高效的树结构表示方法，构建量子算法实现小波包和波原子变换。

Result: 量子算法的门复杂度为$O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$，优于经典算法的$O(n 2^n)$浮点运算。

Conclusion: 该结果可用于改进现有量子算法求解双曲偏微分方程。

Abstract: This paper constructs the first quantum algorithm for wavelet packet
transforms with a tree structure, sometimes called wave atom transforms.
Classically, wave atoms are used to construct sparse representations of
differential operators, which enable fast numerical algorithms for partial
differential equations. Compared to previous work, our quantum algorithm can
implement a larger class of wavelet and wave atom transforms, by using an
efficient representation for a larger class of possible tree structures. Our
quantum implementation has $O(\mathrm{poly}(n))$ gate complexity for the
transform of dimension $2^n$, while classical implementations have $O(n 2^n)$
floating point operations. The result can be used to improve existing quantum
algorithms for solving hyperbolic partial differential equations.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种低成本协议用于大规模Pauli Path模拟器（PPS）实验的运行时和内存估计，并探讨了PPS作为科学发现工具的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Result: 发现减小截断参数δ不总能提高精度，且较深的量子电路可能更容易模拟。

Conclusion: 为PPS的可靠验证和补充估计提供了实用指南，并发布了BlueQubit SDK工具包。

Abstract: In this this paper we present an inexpensive protocol to perform runtime and
memory estimation for large-scale experiments with Pauli Path simulators (PPS).
Additionally, we propose a conceptually simple solution for studying whether
PPS can be used as a scientific discovery tool, rather than reproducing
existing answers. We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients
tracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic
convergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain
regularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements
for smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\delta$. We then
introduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous
error guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating
quantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is
apparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\delta$. This
serves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on
the frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent
convergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied
to IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both
behaviors are realized. Some of our key findings challenge conventional
intuition: reducing $\delta$ does not always improve accuracy, and deeper
quantum circuits may actually be easier to simulate than shallower ones. The
BlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering
researchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical
simulation approach. These results establish practical guidelines for when PPS
can serve as a reliable verification tool versus when it should be used as a
complementary estimate alongside quantum experiments.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了光前（LF）量子场论（QFT）模拟中量子资源（如纠缠和魔术态）的利用方式，发现LF模拟比瞬时形式（IF）模拟需要更少的量子资源。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨光前（LF）量子场论模拟中量子资源（如纠缠和魔术态）的利用方式，并与瞬时形式（IF）模拟进行比较。

Method: 使用(1+1)D横向场Ising模型，推导LF能量算子，分析其与IF哈密顿量的区别，并计算动量空间魔术态。

Result: LF动量空间的本征态是可分离的，而IF动量空间的本征态存在纠缠；LF基态需要更少的魔术态资源。

Conclusion: LF模拟比IF模拟更高效，因其基态更简单且需要更少的量子资源。

Abstract: In the light-front (LF) formulation of quantum field theory (QFT), physics is
formulated from the perspective of a massless observer necessarily traveling at
the speed of light. The LF formulation provides an alternative computational
approach to lattice gauge theory, and has recently been investigated as a
future application of quantum computers. A natural question is how quantum
resources such as entanglement and contextuality amongst physical qubits in the
laboratory are utilized in LF simulations of QFTs. We use the (1+1)D
transverse-field Ising model to explore this question. We derive the LF energy
operator that generates the LF dynamics of the system, which is distinct from
the instant-form (IF) Hamiltonian. We find that while the eigenstates of the IF
Hamiltonian exhibit pairwise entanglement between positive and negative momenta
in IF momentum-space, the eigenstates of the LF Hamiltonian are separable in LF
momentum-space. We then calculate the momentum-space magic of the
IF-momentum-space ground state and show that it always requires more magic to
prepare than the LF-momentum-space ground state. At the quantum critical point,
corresponding to a massless free fermion, both LF and IF ground states are
stabilizers, but the LF ground state is separable in LF momentum-space while
the IF ground state is a product of maximally entangled pairs in IF
momentum-space. These results show that quantum resources such as entanglement
and magic are utilized differently by quantum simulations formulated in LF and
IF, and that the simplicity of the LF ground state results in fewer required
quantum resources.

### [14] [Quantum Advantage in Storage and Retrieval of Isometry Channels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10784)
*Satoshi Yoshida,Jisho Miyazaki,Mio Murao*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文研究了量子通道的存储与检索任务，重点分析了基于估计的策略在等距通道中的渐近性能，并提出了一种更高效的基于端口传输的协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子通道的存储与检索是量子信息处理中的关键任务，但现有方法在等距通道中表现不佳，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 分析了基于估计的策略的渐近性能，并提出了一种基于端口传输的新协议。

Result: 发现基于估计的策略在等距通道中次优，新协议显著提高了效率，程序成本更低。

Conclusion: 新协议为量子通道存储与检索提供了更高效的解决方案，适用于更广泛的量子通道。

Abstract: Storage and retrieval refer to the task of encoding a quantum channel
$\Lambda$ into a quantum state, known as the program state, such that the
channel can later be retrieved. This task is closely related to quantum channel
estimation, where multiple queries to $\Lambda$ are used to prepare a quantum
state $\phi_\Lambda$ that encodes information about the channel. The channel
can then be retrieved by measuring $\phi_\Lambda$, following a
measure-and-prepare strategy. In this work, we analyze the asymptotic
performance of the estimation-based strategy for storage and retrieval of
isometry channels. We show that the optimal fidelity for isometry estimation is
given by $F = 1-{d(D-d)\over n} + O(n^{-2})$, where $d$ and $D$ denote the
input and output dimensions of the isometry, and $n$ is the number of queries.
This result indicates that, unlike in the case of unitary channels, the
estimation-based strategy is suboptimal for the storage and retrieval of
isometry channels, which requires $n = \Theta(\epsilon^{-1})$ to achieve the
diamond-norm error $\epsilon$. To address this limitation, we propose a more
efficient protocol based on port-based teleportation, which stores the isometry
channel in a program state using only $n = \Theta(1/\sqrt{\epsilon})$ queries.
As an application, we extend our approach to general quantum channels,
achieving improved program cost compared to prior results by Gschwedtner,
Bluhm, and Winter [Quantum $\textbf{5}$, 488 (2021)].

Result: 展示了量子相关性在通信任务中的优势，包括qutrit优于qubit纠缠的情况。

Conclusion: 非局域性在经典通信任务中具有显著优势，量子相关性可以超越经典辅助的随机性。

Abstract: We reveal key connections between non-locality and advantage in
correlation-assisted classical communication. First, using the wire-cutting
technique, we provide a Bell inequality tailored to any correlation-assisted
bounded classical communication task. The violation of this inequality by a
quantum correlation is equivalent to its quantum-assisted advantage in the
corresponding communication task. Next, we introduce wire-reading, which
leverages the readability of classical messages to demonstrate advantageous
assistance of non-local correlations in setups where no such advantage can be
otherwise observed. Building on this, we introduce families of classical
communication tasks in a Bob-without-input prepare-and-measure scenario, where
non-local correlation enhances bounded classical communication while shared
randomness assistance yields strictly suboptimal payoff. For the first family
of tasks, assistance from any non-local facet leads to optimal payoff, while
each task in the second family is tailored to a non-local facet. We reveal
quantum advantage in these tasks, including qutrit over qubit entanglement
advantage.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: In quantum resource theories (QRTs) certain quantum states and operations are
deemed more valuable than others. While the determination of the ``free''
elements is usually guided by the constraints of some experimental setup, this
can make it difficult to study similarities and differences between QRTs. In
this work, we argue that QRTs follow from the choice of a preferred algebraic
structure $\mathcal{E}$ to be preserved, thus setting the free operations as
the automorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. We illustrate our finding by determining
$\mathcal{E}$ for the QRTs of entanglement, Clifford stabilizerness, purity,
imaginarity, fermionic Gaussianity, reference frames, thermodynamics and
coherence; showing instances where $\mathcal{E}$ is a Lie algebra, group, ring,
or even a simple set. This unified understanding allows us to generalize the
concept of stochastic local operations and classical communication (SLOCC) to
identify novel resource non-increasing operations for Lie-algebra based QRTs,
thus finding a new solution to an open problem in the literature. We showcase
the sanity of our new set of operations by rigorously proving that they map
free states to free states, as well as determine more general situations where
these transformations strictly do not increase the resource of a state.

Motivation: 探索不同自旋大小对模型波函数的影响，挑战了自旋-$1/2$情况可推广的常见假设。

Method: 通过独立处理每个自旋大小，确定时间演化的渐近波函数，并验证平均场理论在有限自旋算子乘积下的精确性。

Result: 稳态非热，且不符合广义吉布斯系综；平均场理论在特定条件下精确。

Conclusion: 研究结果可通过腔QED和囚禁离子实验验证，揭示了自旋大小对模型行为的独立影响。

Abstract: We determine the exact asymptotic many-body wavefunction of a spin-$s$
Richardson-Gaudin model with a coupling inversely proportional to time, for
time evolution starting from the ground state at $t = 0^+$ and for arbitrary
$s$. Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived
from the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent
treatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast
to the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs
Ensemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite
number of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can
be probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.
