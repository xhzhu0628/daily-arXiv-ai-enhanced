Firstly,\nexploration is hindered over sharp minima, decreasing learning performance.\nSecondly, the steady gradient descent results in more stable and predictable\nmodel transmissions over wireless channels, making the model more susceptible\nto attacks from adversarial entities. Additionally, the local QFL model is\nvulnerable to noise produced by the quantum device's intermediate noise states,\nsince it requires the use of quantum gates and circuits for training. This\nlocal noise becomes intertwined with learning parameters during training,\nimpairing model precision and convergence rate. To address these issues, we\npropose a new QFL technique that incorporates differential privacy and\nintroduces a dedicated noise estimation strategy to quantify and mitigate the\nimpact of intermediate quantum noise. Furthermore, we design an adaptive noise\ngeneration scheme to alleviate privacy threats associated with the vanishing\ngradient variance phenomenon of QNN and enhance robustness against device\nnoise. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm effectively balances\nconvergence, reduces communication costs, and mitigates the adverse effects of\nintermediate quantum noise while maintaining strong privacy protection.

The proposed architecture combines dimensionality reduction\n(via PCA or Autoencoders), quantum state encoding, evolution under an XX\nHamiltonian, and measurement, providing features for a single-layer classifier.\nBy analyzing the performance of QELMs as a function of the evolution time, we\nidentify a relatively sharp transition from a low-accuracy to a high-accuracy\nregime, after which the accuracy saturates. Remarkably, the saturation value\nmatches that achieved with random unitaries, which induce maximally complex\ndynamics and optimally scramble information across the system. Across all cases\nstudied, the critical transition time is sufficient for information to reach\nnearest neighbors, enabling feature extraction for learning, and is independent\nof the system size (i.e., the number of qubits). This independence implies that\nQELMs can be efficiently simulated classically for a broad class of tasks."}

Using natural homomorphisms from line-gap to point-gap\nphases, we distinguish extrinsic phases, reducible to Hermitian or\nanti-Hermitian line-gapped phases, from intrinsic phases, which are genuinely\nnon-Hermitian without Hermitian counterparts. Although classification tables\nfor all symmetry classes were already presented in earlier work, the present\npaper develops a unified formulation and provides explicit computations for all\ninternal symmetries."}

The DRB protocol involves preparing stabilizer\nstates, applying $m$ layers of native single-qubit gates, and measuring in the\ncomputational basis, providing an efficient error characterization under a\nstochastic Pauli noise model. GST enables the full, self-consistent\nreconstruction of quantum processes, including gates, input states, and\nmeasurements. Both protocols provide robust to state preparation and\nmeasurement (SPAM) errors estimations of gate performance, offering\ncomplementary perspectives on quantum gate fidelity. For single-qubit gates,\nDRB yields an average fidelity of $99.963 \\pm 0.016\\%$. The protocol was\nfurther applied to a 25-qubit array under global single-qubit control. GST\nresults are consistent with those obtained via DRB. We also introduce a gauge\noptimization procedure for GST that brings the reconstructed gates, input\nstates, and measurements into a canonical frame, enabling meaningful fidelity\ncomparisons while preserving physical constraints. These constraints of the\noperators -- such as complete positivity and trace preservation -- are enforced\nby performing the optimization over the Stiefel manifold. The combined analysis\nsupports the use of complementary benchmarking techniques for characterizing\nscalable quantum architectures."}
