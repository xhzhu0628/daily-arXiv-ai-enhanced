We investigate whether symmetry constraints can\nprevent this phenomenon. We prove that strongly symmetric thermal states\n(canonical ensemble) of generic Hamiltonians with on-site Abelian symmetries\nremain entangled with non-zero entanglement negativity at arbitrarily high\ntemperatures, under mild conditions on the symmetry actions and the charge\nsector of the strong symmetry. Our results extend to weakly symmetric thermal\nstates (Gibbs ensemble) under superselection rules, which restrict state\ndecompositions to be symmetric. In particular, we show that fermionic Gibbs\nstates do not exhibit sudden death of entanglement and have persistent\nfermionic negativity at high temperatures. These findings demonstrate that\nglobal symmetry correlations can preserve quantum entanglement despite thermal\ndecoherence, providing new insights into the interplay between symmetry and\nquantum information in thermal equilibrium."}

A subclass of the GB code called bivariate bicycle\ncodes (BB codes) has garnered significant interest due to their compatibility\nwith two-layer connectivity architectures on superconducting quantum\nprocessors. However, one key limitation of BB codes is their high qubit\nconnectivity degree requirements (degree 6), which exacerbates the noise\nsusceptibility of the system. Building on the recent progress in implementing\nmultiple two-qubit gates on a single chip, this work introduces Louvre -- a\nrouting-based framework designed to reduce qubit connectivity requirements in\nGB codes. Specifically, Louvre-7 achieves degree reduction while preserving the\ndepth of the syndrome extraction circuit, whereas Louvre-8 further minimizes\nthe connectivity by slightly increasing the circuit depth. When applied to BB\ncodes, these two schemes could reduce the average degree to 4.5 and 4,\nrespectively. Crucially, Louvre eliminates some of the long-range, error-prone\nconnections, which is a distinct advantage over prior approaches. Numerical\nsimulations demonstrate that Louvre-7 has an indistinguishable logical error\nrate as the standard syndrome extraction circuits of GB codes, while Louvre-8\nonly incurs a slight error rate penalty. Furthermore, by reordering some of the\ngates in the circuit, we can reduce the coupler length without degrading the\nperformance. Though most of our analysis focuses on GB codes defined on\nperiodic boundary conditions, we further discuss the adaptability of Louvre to\nopen-boundary lattices and defect-containing grids, underscoring its broader\napplicability in practical quantum error correction architectures."}
