The\naccess traces can have applications in a wide range of scenarios, enabling\nanalysis and profiling of execution of quantum programs and the hardware they\nrun on. As one example use of TraceQ, this work investigates whether such\ntraces can act as a side channel through which an observer can recover the\ncircuit's structure and identify known subroutines in a larger program or even\nwhole programs. The findings show that indeed the minimal access traces can be\nused to recover subroutines or even whole quantum programs with very high\naccuracy.

Inspired by the notion of robustness of magic (RoM) which quantifies the\ncost of quantum-circuit simulation using stabilizer states ($k = 0$), we\nintroduce its generalization, which we call Clifford+$kT$ robustness, treating\nClifford+$kT$ states as free resources. We explore theoretical properties of\nClifford$+kT$ robustness and in particular derive a lower bound that reveals\nthe (in)efficiency of quantum-circuit simulation using Clifford$+kT$ states.\nThrough numerical computations, we also evaluate Clifford+$kT$ robustness for\nkey resource states for universal quantum computation, such as tensor products\nof the magic states.

We here propose a\nmeasurement-based protocol that leverages the resonant Jaynes-Cummings\ninteraction of the bosonic mode with an ancillary two-level atom and sequential\nprojective measurements on the atom. Using the generalized parity measurement\nconstructed by several rounds of free-evolution and measurement with proper\nintervals, we can efficiently filter out the unwanted population and push the\ntarget mode conditionally toward the desired Fock state. In ideal situation, a\nFock state $|n_t\\approx2000\\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity over $98\\%$\nusing only $8$ rounds of measurements. With qubit dissipation and dephasing and\ncavity decay in the current circuit QED platforms, a Fock state\n$|n_t\\approx100\\rangle$ can be prepared with a fidelity about $80\\%$ by $6$\nmeasurements. It is found that the number of the measurement rounds for\npreparing a large Fock state $|n_t\\rangle$ scales roughly as\n$\\log_2\\sqrt{n_t}$, similar to the number of ancillary qubits required in the\nstate preparation via the quantum phase estimation algorithm yet costs much\nless gate operations. Our protocol can also be used to prepare a large Dicke\nstate $|J<1000,0\\rangle$ of a spin ensemble with a sufficiently high fidelity\nby less than $3$ measurements, which is qualified for the quantum Fisher\ninformation approaching the Heisenberg scaling in sensing the rotation phase\nalong the $x$ axis."}

On the other hand, as quantum systems interact with\ntheir surroundings, decoherence emerges, leading to the gradual decay of\nquantum coherence and entanglement. In the case of entanglement, this is known\nas entanglement sudden death (ESD). Decoherence mechanisms are examined,\nfocusing on how various environmental factors, such as thermal,\nelectromagnetic, and collisional decoherence, influence the integrity of\nentangled states. The role of quantum noise, such as amplitude damping, phase\ndamping, and depolarizing, is also analyzed. By integrating theoretical\ninsights with experimental findings, this study highlights the delicate balance\nbetween maintaining entanglement and mitigating decoherence.

Based on the\nBronstein inequality, here, we use a totally disconnected topological space\n$\\mathcal{X}$ as a model for the space. However, we consider the time as a real\nvariable. In this framework, the formalism of Dirac-von Neumann can be used.\nThis discreteness hypothesis implies that given two different points in space,\nthere is no continuous curve (a world line) joining them. Consequently, this\nhypothesis is not compatible with the theory of relativity. We propose\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})^{3}$ as a model of a space-time.\nFor simplicity, we work out our models using\n$\\mathbb{R}\\times(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ as the configuration space.\nQuantum mechanics (QM), in the sense of Dirac-von Neumann, on the Hilbert space\n$L^{2}(\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathcal{X})$ is a non-local theory: the Hamiltonians\nare non-local operators, and thus, spooky action at a distance is allowed. The\nparadigm asserting that the universe is non-locally real implies that the\nproposed version of QM admits realism. This version of QM can be specialized to\nstandard QM by using Hamiltonians acting on wavefunctions supported on the\nregion $\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}$. We apply the developed formalism to the\nmeasurement problem. We propose a new mechanism for the collapse of the\nwavefunction. The mechanism resembles the one proposed by Ghirardi, Ramini, and\nWeber, but there are significant differences. The most important feature is\nthat the Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation describes the dynamics at all times, even at\nthe moment of measurement.

This can be used in\nquantum networks to perform applications such as blind quantum computing or\nlong-distance quantum key distribution (QKD) with quantum repeaters. Devices to\nperform RSP, referred to as a client, ideally have low hardware requirements,\nsuch as only sending photonic qubits. A weak coherent pulse source offers a\npractical alternative to true single-photon sources and is already widely used\nin QKD. Here, we introduce two new protocols to the previously known protocol\nfor RSP with a weak-coherent-pulse-based device. The known technique uses a\ndouble-click (DC) protocol, where a photon from both the server and the client\nneeds to reach an intermediate Bell state measurement. Here, we add to that a\nsingle-click (SC) RSP protocol, which requires only one photon to reach the\nBell state measurement, allowing for better performance in certain regimes. In\naddition, we introduce a double-single-click (DSC) protocol, where the SC\nprotocol is repeated twice, and a CNOT gate is applied between the resulting\nqubits. DSC mitigates the need for phase stabilization in certain regimes,\nlowering technical complexity while still improving performance compared to DC\nin some regimes. We compare these protocols in terms of fidelity and rate,\nfinding that SC consistently achieves higher rates than DC and, interestingly,\ndoes not suffer from an inherently lower fidelity than the DC, as is the case\nfor entanglement generation. Although SC provides stronger performance, DSC can\nstill show performance improvements over DC, and it may have reduced technical\ncomplexity compared to SC. Lastly, we show how these protocols can be used in\nlong-distance QKD using quantum repeaters."}
