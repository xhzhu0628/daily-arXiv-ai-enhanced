We also provide an\noperational meaning for the temporal evolution consistent with such\ncorrelations in terms of a generalized dephasing channel and a pretty good\nmeasurement. The two temporal evolutions turn out to not be Petz recovery maps\nof each other, but are Bayesian inverses of each other.

If the distance that separates a pair of emitters meets specific\nresonance conditions, the photons produced from decay may destructively\ninterfere. In an infinite-wavelength setting, this effect gives rise to bound\nstates in the continuum, where a photon remains confined in between the\nemitter. In the case of a finite-length waveguide with two periodic boundary\nconditions, the relevant distances become two, leading to states in which a\nphoton is confined in either the shorter or the longer path that connects the\nemitters. If the ratio of the shorter and the longer path is a rational number,\nthese two kinds of resonant states are allowed to co-exist in the same\nHamiltonian. In this paper, we investigate the existence of quasi-degenerate\nresonant doublets of a pair of identical emitters coupled to a linear waveguide\nmode. The states that form the doublet are searched among the ones in which a\nsingle excitation tends to remain bound to the emitters.

Recent literature, however, has increasingly\nexplored the characterization of resources in multi-states (ordered collections\nof states indexed by a varying parameter). In this work, we provide a\nunitary-invariant framework to pinpoint imaginarity and coherence in sets of\nqubit states: we prove that Bloch vectors must be coplanar to be\nimaginarity-free and colinear to be incoherent, yielding exact rank-based tests\nof coherence and imaginarity, and closed-form bounds for existing robustness\nquantifiers, all based on two-state overlaps only. We also show that the set of\nimaginarity-free multi-states is not convex, and that third-order invariants\ncompletely characterize multi-state imaginarity of single-qubits but not of\nhigher-dimensional systems. As our main technical result, we show that every\nBargmann invariant of single-qubit states is determined (up to conjugation) by\ntwo-state overlaps.

We demonstrate that the scar subspace can be\neffectively described using the standard spectrum-generating algebra (SGA)\nframework and through a group-theoretical formulation of the Hamiltonian.

We propose two alternative techniques:\napproximated SGA and generalized SGA, which construct and describe the scar\nsubspace in the XYZ case.
