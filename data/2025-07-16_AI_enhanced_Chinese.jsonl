A shared aspect is, for instance, their vulnerability to adversarial\ninputs, small perturbations that can lead to incorrect predictions. While\nformal verification techniques have been extensively developed for classical\nmodels, no comparable framework exists for certifying the robustness of VQCs.\nHere, we present the first in-depth theoretical and practical study of the\nformal verification problem for VQCs.

We show that\nquantum-specific aspects, such as state normalization, introduce inter-variable\ndependencies that challenge existing approaches.

We start by analyzing the dynamics of the Pauli coefficients\ntracked in the Heisenberg picture. In addition to surprisingly generic\nconvergence features of the Pauli coefficient distributions, we find certain\nregularities that allow for extrapolation of memory and runtime requirements\nfor smaller and smaller coefficient truncation parameter $\\delta$. We then\nintroduce a framework for understanding convergence in the absence of rigorous\nerror guarantees on PPS. Combined with runtime analysis, we propose bifurcating\nquantum simulation problems broadly into two classes, based on whether there is\napparent convergence of expectation values as a function of $\\delta$. This\nserves as a way for practitioners to understand where their problem falls on\nthe frontier of classical simulability. In the case without apparent\nconvergence, PPS may still serve useful as a Monte Carlo-like estimate. Applied\nto IBM's utility-scale experiments, we show parameter regimes where both\nbehaviors are realized.

The\nBlueQubit SDK implementing these methods has been released publicly, offering\nresearchers a comprehensive toolkit for evaluating this frontier classical\nsimulation approach.

This task is closely related to quantum channel\nestimation, where multiple queries to $\\Lambda$ are used to prepare a quantum\nstate $\\phi_\\Lambda$ that encodes information about the channel.

Contrary to common belief, the resulting wavefunction cannot be derived\nfrom the spin-$1/2$ case by merging spins, but instead requires independent\ntreatment for each spin size. The steady state is non-thermal and, in contrast\nto the spin-$1/2$ case, does not conform to a natural Generalized Gibbs\nEnsemble. We show that mean-field theory is exact for any product of a finite\nnumber of spin operators on different sites. We discuss how these findings can\nbe probed in cavity QED and trapped ion experiments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb-$s$ Richardson-Gaudin\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u53cd\u6bd4\u8026\u5408\u4e0b\u7684\u591a\u4f53\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u7a33\u6001\u975e\u70ed\u4e14\u65e0\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u5e76\u81ea\u65cb\u4ece\u81ea\u65cb-$1/2$\u60c5\u51b5\u63a8\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb-$1/2$\u60c5\u51b5\u53ef\u63a8\u5e7f\u7684\u5e38\u89c1\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u6bcf\u4e2a\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\uff0c\u786e\u5b9a\u65f6\u95f4\u6f14\u5316\u7684\u6e10\u8fd1\u6ce2\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u6709\u9650\u81ea\u65cb\u7b97\u5b50\u4e58\u79ef\u4e0b\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u7a33\u6001\u975e\u70ed\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u7b26\u5408\u5e7f\u4e49\u5409\u5e03\u65af\u7cfb\u7efc\uff1b\u5e73\u5747\u573a\u7406\u8bba\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7cbe\u786e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u7ed3\u679c\u53ef\u901a\u8fc7\u8154QED\u548c\u56da\u7981\u79bb\u5b50\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u81ea\u65cb\u5927\u5c0f\u5bf9\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u72ec\u7acb\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}
