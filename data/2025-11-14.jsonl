The identified generating function also indicates that the underlying framework can be classified as a divergence-type theory."}

Although not topologically protected, the qubit leverages distinct spatial profiles to couple to two independent environmental baths, realizing the phenomenon of quantum frustration.This mechanism is tested against the threat of quasiparticle poisoning (QP). I show that frustration is effective against Ohmic noise ($s=1$) and has some protection for $0.76<s<1$ sub-Ohmic noise. However, the experimentally prevalent $1/f$ noise ($s\\to0$) falls deep within the model's localized phase, where frustration is insufficient. This causes Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking and catastrophic decoherence. The qubit's viability depends on what is the effective environment that these local Majorana wave functions experience."}

The protocol utilizes local couplings between two copies of an SYK model to create a gapped adiabatic path, between a high temperature product state and a low temperature thermofield double state. By smoothly varying the coupling strength between these two limits, one efficiently cools the SYK model. We support these predictions-and demonstrate fast cooling to the low-temperature gravitational regime-via exact numerical solutions to the large-N equations of motion that govern the ground state and dynamical properties of the coupled system. Finally, we present a theoretical framework based upon eigenstate thermalization that provides a microscopic explanation for the efficacy of the cooling protocol; intriguingly, this suggests that the protocol may be applicable for cooling strongly-interacting quantum Hamiltonians more broadly."}

Here we experimentally achieve controllable vacuum-state freezing in programmable Rydberg arrays of up to 100 atoms through many-body Stückelberg interference, with visibility exceeding $70\\%$ and excitation suppression to $1\\%$ despite periodic driving that would typically induce heating. Comparing single and dual-frequency protocols across multiple geometries, we show that simultaneous modulation of detuning and Rabi frequency dramatically enhances interference-driven freezing. Finite-range interaction tails play a decisive role, producing interference patterns which constrained $PXP$ models cannot capture.

Yet, most provable guarantees for quantum algorithms rely exclusively on Grover-type methods that cap the possible advantage at only quadratic speed-ups, making the search for approaches that surpass this quadratic barrier a key challenge. In this light, this work presents a rigorous worst-case runtime analysis of a recently introduced measurement-driven quantum SAT solver. Importantly, this quantum algorithm does not exclusively rely on Grover-type methods and shows promising numerical performance. Our analysis establishes that the algorithm's runtime depends on an exponential trade-off between two key properties: the spectral gap of the associated Hamiltonian and the success probability of the driving measurements. We show that this trade-off can be systematically controlled by a tunable rotation angle. Beyond establishing a worst-case runtime expression, this work contributes significant algorithmic improvements. First, we develop a new readout routine that efficiently finds a solution even for instances with multiple satisfying assignments. Second, a measurement parallelization scheme, based on perfect hash families, is introduced. Third, we establish an amplitude-amplified version of the measurement-driven algorithm. Finally, we demonstrate the practical utility of our framework: By suitably scheduling the algorithm's parameters, we show that its runtime collapses from exponential to polynomial on a special class of SAT instances, consistent with their known classical tractability. A problem we leave open is to establish a non-trivial lower bound on the spectral gap as a function of the rotation angle. Resolving this directly translates into an improved worst-case runtime, potentially realizing a super-quadratic quantum advantage."}

By randomly choosing a protocol according to a probability distribution over a list of protocols for each pair we want to produce, we can achieve rates and fidelities not achieved by any of the original protocols.

In this work, instead of machine learning (ML) algorithms that improve the code performance through local transformations, we impose additional global symmetries, that are hard to discover through ML, and we perform an exhaustive search. Precisely, we focus on the hypergraph product of two cyclic codes, which we call CxC codes and we study C2 codes which are the product a cyclic code with itself and CxR codes which are the product of a cyclic codes with a repetition code. We discover C2 codes and CxR codes that significantly outperform previously optimized HGP codes, achieving better parameters and a logical error rate per logical qubit that is up to three orders of magnitude better. Moreover, some C2 codes achieve simultaneously a lower logical error rate and a smaller qubit overhead than state-of-the-art LDPC codes such as the bivariate bicycle codes, at the price of a larger block length.

In standard QPF, the output state has a primary contribution from $r$ high-probability bit strings, where $r$ is the period. Measurement of this state, combined with continued fraction analysis, reveals the unknown period. Here, we explore a different approach to QPF, where the period is obtained from single-qubit quantities $-$ specifically, the set of one-qubit reduced density matrices (1-RDMs) $-$ rather than the output bit strings of the entire quantum circuit. Using state-vector simulations, we compute the 1-RDMs of the QPF circuit for a generic periodic function. Analysis of these 1-RDMs as a function of period reveals distinctive patterns, which allows us to obtain the unknown period from the 1-RDMs using a numerical root-finding approach. Our results show that the 1-RDMs $-$ a set of $O(n)$ one-qubit marginals $-$ contain enough information to reconstruct the period, which is typically obtained by sampling the space of $O(2^n)$ bit strings.

Here we present an analog, continuous-variable algorithm based on coupled bosonic modes with qubit-based adaptive measurements that avoids Hilbert-space digitization. This method encodes classical fields as coherent states and, via Kraus-channel composition derived from the Koopman-von Neumann (KvN) formalism, maps nonlinear evolution to linear dynamics. Unlike many analog schemes, the algorithm is provably efficient: advancing a first-order, $L$-grid point, $d$-dimensional, order-$K$ spatial-derivative, degree-$r$ polynomial-nonlinearity, strongly dissipative partial differential equations (PDEs) for $T$ time steps costs $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T(\\log L + d r \\log K)\\right)$.

Our comparison focuses on the $k$-body reduced density matrix ($k$-RDM) as well as two standard bosonic Hamiltonians. The first quantized mappings use less resources for off-diagonal terms of the $k$-RDM by a factor of $ \\sim N^k$, compared to the second quantized mappings. The number of gates for the first quantized binary mapping increases faster with $M$ compared to the other mappings.

Experimental observation of backflow has remained elusive due to two main challenges: (i) the effect is intrinsically small, with less than 4% of the probability able to flow backward, and (ii) it requires wave packets with a well-defined momentum direction, which are difficult both to prepare and to verify under realistic, noisy conditions. Here, we overcome these challenges by introducing a general formulation of quantum backflow applicable to arbitrary momentum distributions. The framework recovers the standard backflow limit for unidirectional states and identifies general backflow as probability flow exceeding that predicted by the particle's momentum distribution alone. We show that this excess can reach nearly 13%, surpassing the standard backflow bound by more than a factor of three. Furthermore, we extend the framework to the closely related phenomenon of quantum reentry, provide explicit examples of quantum states exhibiting large general backflow and reentry, and discuss the foundational implications of these nonclassical effects. Our results open a pathway toward the experimental observation of quantum backflow in realistic settings."}

Potentially high encoding rates and large distance relative to their block size make them appealing for practical suppression of noise in near-term quantum computers. In addition to increased qubit-connectivity requirements compared to more conventional topological quantum error correcting codes, qLDPC codes remain notoriously hard to compute with. In this work, we introduce a construction to implement all Clifford quantum gate operations on the recently introduced lift-connected surface (LCS) codes (Old et al. 2024). These codes can be implemented in a 3D-local architecture and achieve asymptotic scaling $[[n, \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3}), \\mathcal{O}(n^{1/3})]]$. In particular, LCS codes realize favorable instances with small numbers of qubits: For the $[[15,3,3]]$ LCS code, we provide deterministic fault-tolerant (FT) circuits of the logical gate set $\\{\\overline{H}_i, \\overline{H}_i, \\overline{C_i X_j}\\}_{i,j \\in (0,1,2)}$ based on flag qubits.

On one hand, by designing the non-Markovian coupling parameters between the waveguide and resonator, single or two-photon transport and the resulting photon blockade effect can be manipulated according to the output photonic states at the end of waveguide. This non-Markovian process can be evaluated by scattering matrices and second order correlation functions related to the distance between two coupled points.

With an additional eigenvalue-shifting technique, the improved complexity depends on the spectral range of the system instead of its spectral norm.

In this regime, the ability of quantum processors to scale in size and depth has become a crucial factor shaping their achievable performance. This study investigates how finite scalability influences resource requirements for simulating open-shell catalytic systems using Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The analysis compares hardware archetypes distinguished by fidelity or operation speed under two representative scalability models. Finite scalability increases qubit and runtime demands yet leaves overall scaling behavior intact, with high-fidelity architectures requiring lower minimum scalability to solve equally sized problems. These effects are largely independent of the chosen scalability model. Extending this framework, we examine runtime competitiveness across hardware and code configurations, incorporating surface-code and quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC)-based fault tolerance under finite scalability. The results identify operating regimes where high-fidelity architectures remain competitive despite slower gate speeds and show that LDPC codes further expand this regime by reducing space-time overhead. Together, these findings highlight the central role of scalability in quantifying performance and guiding the design of next-generation quantum hardware. Continued progress in scalable architectures will be essential for extending quantum computing to increasingly complex scientific and industrial applications."}

Through calculating their complex spectra, we find these models are subject to a gapless-gapped phase transition with dissipation rate if the transverse field is larger than a model-dependent value. Interestingly, the variation of the complex gap with the dissipation rate is not monotonous, instead it manifest oscillations before entering the gapped phase. By simulating their non-unitary evolution, we show that the entanglement entropy of the steady state would transition from a volume-law to an area-law scaling with the increase of the dissipation rate. Meanwhile, some unexpected results about the entanglement entropy appear in the volume-law phase. These unusual features of the complex gap and the steady-state entanglement can be attributed to level crossings between the maximal imagine level and other levels.

At intermediate times the sum lies strictly below the bound due to phase-space overlap in local mixtures, quantitatively accounting for entanglement growth as a redistribution of a finite, budgeted resource into shared correlations. We establish the result analytically for two bodies and corroborate it numerically in engineered state-transfer chains, where it reveals a coherence-enabled dark transport: the resource becomes locally invisible while being stored in multi-body coherences. The predicted trajectory of the summed local negativity provides a practical hardware metric: deviations from the ideal, budgeted curve diagnose decoherence and control error."}

However, their deeper impact on the fine structure of quantum correlations remains a key open question. In this work, we explore a bosonic nonlocal field theory, examining correlation measures beyond entanglement entropy, namely, mutual information and tripartite information. Using numerical lattice simulations, we show that the nonlocality scale, \\(A\\), not only determines the onset of volume-law behavior but also leads to striking features: notably, extremely long-range mutual information and an unusual monogamy structure. In this regime, increasing the separation between large regions can paradoxically enhance their multipartite entanglement. Through holographic duality, we verify that the Ryu-Takayanagi formula correctly captures the volume-law scaling of entropy. Yet, a significant tension emerges: while the field theory reveals rich spatial correlations, the holographic model predicts a complete suppression of both mutual and tripartite information in the volume-law phase. This non-monogamous behavior in the holographic description stands in sharp contrast to the monogamous and highly structured entanglement observed in the field theory. Our results demonstrate that nonlocality gives rise to quantum states of such complexity that conventional geometric models of spacetime fall short. This points to the need for a new framework that goes beyond geometry to fully capture the nature of these correlations."}

An example is the density of a material which is subject to zero point fluctuations in the phonon vacuum state. These distributions can decrease very slowly, leading to a relatively high probability for large fluctuations. If the operator is measured by a laser pulse, the rate of decrease of the distribution mirrors the rate of decrease of the pulse envelope Fourier transform. We describe a model for the creation of isolated pulses in which this Fourier transform falls as an exponential of a fractional power of frequency and find examples where this fraction is in the range 0.1 to 0.2. The probability distribution for large fluctuation has the same functional form and implies a significant probability for fluctuations very large compared to the variance."}

This framework can be generalised to partial projected ensembles in tripartite settings, where outcomes from part of the measured subsystem are discarded, leading to ensembles of mixed states. We show that information measures defined for such ensembles, in particular the Holevo information, yield a more detailed characterisation of how quantum information is distributed between subsystems compared to conventional entanglement measures. Using exact analytical results supported by numerical results, we uncover a qualitative change in the scaling of the Holevo information with system size in partial projected ensembles generated by Haar-random states, as the relative sizes of the subsystem are varied. In one phase, the Holevo information decays exponentially with system size, while in the other it grows linearly, thereby defining distinct information phases separated by sharp transitions signalled by non-analyticities in the Holevo information. The exponentially decaying phase rigorously establishes the existence of a measurement-invisible quantum-correlated phase -- a manifestation of many-body information scrambling with no bipartite analogue. Finally, we contrast this information-phase diagram with the entanglement-phase structure of tripartite Haar-random states obtained from logarithmic negativity, and show that the Holevo information reveals additional fine structure beyond conventional entanglement measures."}

Despite its importance, the reaction time and its impact on the design of the logical microarchitecture of a quantum computer are not well understood. In this work, we build, for a surface code based architecture, a model for the reaction time in which the decoder latency is based on parallel space- and time-window decoding methods, and communication latencies are drawn from our envisioned quantum execution environment comprising a high-speed network of quantum processing units, controllers, decoders, and high-performance computing nodes. We use this model to estimate the increase in the logical error rate of magic state injections as a function of the reaction time. Next, we show how the logical microarchitecture can be optimized with respect to the reaction time, and then present detailed full-system quantum and classical resource estimates for executing utility-scale quantum circuits based on realistic hardware noise parameters and state-of-the-art decoding times. For circuits with $10^{6}$--$10^{11}$ $T$ gates involving 200--2000 logical qubits, under a $Λ=9.3$ hardware model representative of a realistic target for superconducting quantum processors operating at a 2.86 MHz stabilization frequency, we show that even decoding at a sub-microsecond per stabilization round speed introduces substantial resource overheads: approximately 100k--250k additional physical qubits for correction qubit storage in the magic state factory; 300k--1.75M extra physical qubits in the core processor due to the code distance increase of $d$ to $d+4$ for extra memory protection; and a longer runtime by roughly a factor of 100."}

Whether similar ordering persists in multimode reservoirs with propagation and competing collective decay channels remains an open question. We address this problem by analyzing atoms coupled to one-dimensional electromagnetic baths through two models. The first is a ring cavity supporting two bright collective decay channels, and the second is a bidirectional waveguide where, in addition to competition between channels, propagation induces coherent dipole-dipole interactions. For suitable incoherent pumping strengths, the dynamics enters a synchronization window in which collective decay overcomes disordering processes, leading to spontaneous steady-state phase ordering and superradiant emission. We extract the thresholds marking the onset of synchronization and show that the maximum intensity scales quadratically in both models. The resulting order is not described by a single macroscopic dipole: in the ring cavity spontaneous chirality emerges at the level of individual trajectories, while the waveguide develops a local chirality with different orders dominating opposite ends of the atomic array. The analysis of the emitted light spectrum reveals a linewidth that seems to narrow with increased system size in the ring cavity, while narrowing in the waveguide remains inconclusive within accessible numerics. These results clarify how competition and propagation shape emergent order in one-dimensional reservoirs and identify regimes where steady-state superradiance may arise beyond the Dicke limit."}
