As a crucial\ncomponent, decoding architectures have received significant attention recently.\nIn this paper, we introduce LATTE, a FPGA-CPU hybrid decoding architecture\naiming to address the key requirements of scaling up in lattice surgery quantum\ncomputation -- Latency, Accuracy, Throughput and Transmission Bandwidth, in an\nEclectic manner. LATTE follows a hierarchical design: (1) A fully streaming and\nasynchronous block decoding system on CPU to enable parallelization both\ntemporally and spatially. (2) A super-light yet accurate neural local decoding\nunit integrated with quantum control hardware on FPGA, which remains\n\\emph{transparent} to the block decoding system, effectively reducing\ntransmission bandwidth and accelerating the decoding process. LATTE delivers\naccuracy on par with the base decoder while achieving real-time decoding\nthroughput and significantly reducing both bandwidth requirements and\ncomputational resources, enabling a level of scalability far beyond previous\napproaches. Under circuit-level noise $p=0.001$, LATTE achieves over\n$\\mathbf{90\\%}$ reduction in transmission bandwidth and a $\\mathbf{6.4\\times}$\nspeedup on average in single-block decoding. In the \\emph{streaming decoding}\nscenario: (1) LATTE achieves constant and low latency\n($\\mathbf{16\\times}$-$\\mathbf{20\\times}$ speedup over existing streaming\ndecoding implementations) in arbitrarily long quantum memory experiments, with\nnear-optimal resources -- merely $\\mathbf{2}$ threads are sufficient for\ndecoding the surface code with distance up to $17$. (2) LATTE minimizes latency\nin multi-patch measurement experiments through highly parallelized decoding\noperations. These combined efforts ensure sufficient scalability for\nlarge-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing."}

At zero\ntemperature, we demonstrate that this model hosts three phases separated by two\nsecond-order and one first-order transitions. These lines intersect at a TCP\nand a UCEP, the latter not captured by existing phase-transition paradigms. The\nUCEP displays one-sided criticality: approaching the point from one side, the\nsystem behaves as a second-order transition, while from the other side it is\nfirst-order. Correspondingly, two order parameters, respectively, undergo the\nfirst- and the second-order phase transitions at the same point. We construct a\nminimal description of UCEP with the density of the free energy $f =\nc_{1}(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})+(\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2})^{2}\\ln{\\vert\\tilde{\\alpha}^{2}+c_{2}\\vert}$,\nwith the UCEP at $(c_{1},c_{2})=(1/e,0)$ and $\\tilde{\\alpha}$ being the order\nparameter. We further map the finite-temperature phase diagram and perform a\nsymmetry analysis. By unifying first- and second-order signatures in a single,\ndirection-dependent endpoint, the UCEP introduces a qualitatively new class of\nphase transition and may have applications in fields such as quantum\nmeasurement and quantum sensing. This work also provides an intriguing platform\nfor exploring novel critical phenomena in cavity-coupled many-body systems with\nor without dissipation."}

Our\nconstruction is a variation of the Feynman-Kitaev clock -- a well-known mapping\nbetween quantum circuits and local Hamiltonians -- where the clock register is\ngiven periodic boundary conditions. Assuming the eigenstate thermalization\nhypothesis (ETH) holds for the input circuit, our construction yields\nHamiltonians whose eigenstates have properties characteristic of infinite\ntemperature, like volume-law entanglement entropy, across the whole spectrum --\nincluding the ground state. We then construct a family of exactly solvable\nFloquet quantum circuits whose eigenstates are shown to obey the ETH at\ninfinite temperature. Combining the two constructions yields a new family of\nlocal Hamiltonians with provably volume-law-entangled ground states, and the\nfirst such construction where the volume law holds for all contiguous\nsubsystems."}
