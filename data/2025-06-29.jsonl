However, despite the improvements to\nexisting quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known\nabout \\textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it\nchallenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In\nthis work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum\ndifferential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation\n(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a\nunitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make\nseveral algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization\nbounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme\nfor the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for\noblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest.

The worldline of a free\nelectron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function\nwhose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz\ntransformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's\nglobal motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic\nmotion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the\nultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\\omega_0$ found by Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nin his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the\n\\emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition\nof Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents\nare due to the zitter motion. In an inertial \"rest\"-frame fixed at the inertia\ncenter, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified\ndirection implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent\nperpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius\n$c/\\omega_0 = \\hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to\nthis spin direction. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin\ncenter without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin\ncenter, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the\nelectro-magnetic potential. This analysis confirms the nature of ZBW directly\nfrom Dirac's equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck,\nHestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical electron models.

In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of\nthe system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary\ntransformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter\nestimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL),\nspecifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum\noptimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system\nfor the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a\nbackground magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective\nmeasurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by\napplying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL\nagent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a\ntransverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to\nexisting sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against\nvarious Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to\ninvestigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find\nthat the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as\nthe pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to\ngeneralize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings."}

An area of\nmachine learning that has not yet been explored is neural ordinary differential\nequation (neural ODE) based residual neural networks (ResNets), which aim to\nimprove the effectiveness of neural networks using the principles of ordinary\ndifferential equations. In this work, we present our insights about why analog\nRydberg atom quantum computers are especially well-suited for ResNets. We also\nintroduce ResQ, a novel framework to optimize the dynamics of Rydberg atom\nquantum computers to solve classification problems in machine learning using\nanalog quantum neural ODEs."}
