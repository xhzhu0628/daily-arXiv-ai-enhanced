A decisive factor\nfor its performance is the numerical representation of the Bayesian probability\ndistributions. In this work, we explore advanced statistical methods for this\npurpose, and numerically analyze their performance against the state-of-the-art\nin quantum parameter learning. In particular, we consider sequential importance\nresampling, tempered likelihood estimation, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, random\nwalk Metropolis (RWM), Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and variants (stochastic\ngradients with and without friction, energy conserving subsampling), block\npseudo-marginal Metropolis-Hastings with subsampling, hybrid HMC-RWM\napproaches, and Gaussian rejection filtering. We demonstrate advantages of\nthese approaches over existing ones, namely robustness under multi-modality and\nhigh dimensionality. We apply these algorithms to the calibration of\nsuperconducting qubits from IBMQ, surpassing the standard quantum limit and\nachieving better results than Qiskit's default tools. In Hahn echo and Ramsey\nexperiments, we reduce the uncertainty by factors of 10 and 3 respectively,\nwithout increasing the number of measurements; conversely, we match the\nperformance of Qiskit's methods while using up to to 99.5% less experimental\ndata. We additionally investigate the roles of adaptivity, dataset ordering and\nheuristics in quantum characterization. Our findings have applications in\nchallenging quantum characterization tasks, namely learning the dynamics of\nopen quantum systems."}

Our readout\nprotocol dynamically adjusts the effective linewidth of the readout resonator\nthrough a tunable filter, optimizing the signal-to-noise ratio during\nmeasurement while suppressing photon noise during idle periods. Achieving a\nreadout fidelity of $99.3\\%$ without using Josephson parametric amplifiers or\ntraveling-wave parametric amplifiers, even with a small dispersive shift,\ndemonstrates its effectiveness. For reset operations, our protocol utilizes the\ntunable coupler adjacent to the target qubit as an intermediary to channel\nqubit excitations into the Purcell filter, enabling rapid dissipation. We\ndemonstrate unconditional reset of both leakage-induced $|2\\rangle$ and\n$|1\\rangle$ states within 200 ns (error rate $\\leq1\\%$), and reset of the\n$|1\\rangle$ state alone in just 75 ns. Repeated reset cycles ($\\leq600$ ns)\nfurther reduce the error rate below $0.1\\%$.
