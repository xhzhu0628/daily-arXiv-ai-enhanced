However, the\nresults obtained on the actual quantum hardware available today, such as IBM's\nsuperconducting qubits and IonQ's trapped ions, indicate large discrepancies\ndue to hardware limitations. This work highlights both the potential and\nchallenges of using quantum computers to solve fundamental quantum molecular\ndynamics problems."}

Given a sufficient\nnumber of neurons, they can reproduce any continuous function to arbitrary\nprecision, with a resource cost that scales linearly in both the input size and\nthe number of trainable parameters. In this work, we present a quantum optical\nprotocol that implements a shallow network with an arbitrary number of neurons.\nBoth the input data and the parameters are encoded into single-photon states.\nLeveraging the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, the network output is determined by the\ncoincidence rates measured when the photons interfere at a beam splitter, with\nmultiple neurons prepared as a mixture of single-photon states. Remarkably,\nonce trained, our model requires constant optical resources regardless of the\nnumber of input features and neurons."}

To this end, an information-theoretic\nconcept of certifying nonobjective information by the Popescu-Rohrlich box\nfraction is employed. Furthermore, in the aforementioned demonstration, a\npartial answer to the question of what distinguishes quantum theory from\ngeneralized nonsignaling theories emerges beyond the one provided by the\nprinciple of information causality alone. This is accomplished by demonstrating\nthat postquantum models identified by the information causality are isolated by\nthe emergence of the Popescu-Rohrlich box fraction of nonobjective information\nin Bell-local boxes of a generalized nonsignaling theory, over the two other\ngeneralized nonsignaling theories that have simplicial local state spaces."}
