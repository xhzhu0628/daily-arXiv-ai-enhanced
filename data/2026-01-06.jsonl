We show that classical and stateless quantum authentication mechanisms fail to enforce continuity and remain vulnerable to fork attacks. To address this gap, we propose the Quantum State Continuity Witness (QSCW), a minimal quantum-assisted primitive that enforces temporal linkage of execution through stateful quantum evolution and cumulative auditing. Using a GHZ-based toy instantiation and extensive simulation, we demonstrate that temporal enforcement suppresses fork attacks with exponential decay in success probability, while remaining robust to noise and system parameters. Our results highlight execution continuity as a distinct and underexplored dimension of system security."}

To date, efficiency limitations have prevented scaling quantum dot-based interference to the coalescence of more than two photons at a single beamsplitter. We overcome this limitation by combining a state-of-the-art quantum dot source with deterministic demultiplexing, enabling the direct observation of quantum interference fringes arising from up to four photons. We measure high mean interference contrasts of $93.0 \\pm 0.1~\\%$ for two photons, and $84.1 \\pm 1.0~\\%$ for four photons, with the complex fringe structure fully reproduced by a theoretical model. These results reveal the existence of \"deep fringes\" whose minima are unaffected by distinguishable photons, rendering the maximum contrast of four-photon interference highly sensitive to multi-photon emission but robust against photon distinguishability. We predict that these phenomena will extend to interference of larger numbers of photons, with relevance across a range of potential optical quantum technologies. A Fisher information analysis demonstrates that interference fringes from our source can exhibit phase sensitivity beyond the standard quantum limit, illustrating potential applications in quantum metrology."}

The validity of our representation is empirically confirmed through a benchmark analysis of the Hadamard walk, demonstrating high fidelity with traditional unitary evolution.

Performance is evaluated using two metrics: the number of objective function evaluations and the number of algorithm iterations required to consistently reach optimal or near optimal solutions across QAP instances with 5 to 10 facilities. The motivation for this study stems from limitations of both classical exact methods and current quantum algorithms. Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs), such as QAOA and VQE, while widely studied, suffer from costly parameter tuning and barren plateaus that hinder convergence. By adopting a non-variational approach, this work explores a potentially more efficient and scalable quantum strategy for combinatorial optimisation.

Within a generic two-level open quantum system framework, we establish quantitative connections between the magnitude of KCC violation and key information-theoretic and thermodynamic quantities, such as mutual information, the Fano factor, heat exchange, and entropy production rate, thereby enabling a thermodynamic interpretation of temporal quantum correlations. Furthermore, we uncover formal correspondences between KCC violation, the Leggett-Garg inequality, and the negativity of the Kirkwood-Dirac quasi-distribution, identifying them as complementary witnesses of temporal quantum non-classicality.

Counterdiabatic protocols suppress diabatic excitations in finite-time adiabatic evolution, but their practical application is limited by the non-local structure of the required Hamiltonians and the resource overhead of fully digital implementations. Counterdiabatic terms can be expressed as truncated expansions of nested commutators of the adiabatic Hamiltonian and its parametric derivative. Here, we show how this algebraic structure can be efficiently realized in a digital-analog setting using commutator product formulas. Using native multi-qubit analog interactions augmented by local single-qubit rotations, this approach enables higher-order counterdiabatic protocols whose implementation requires a constant number of analog blocks for any fixed truncation order, independent of system size. We demonstrate the method for two-dimensional spin models and analyze the associated approximation errors.

Using a reward based on the positive time derivative of the trace distance associated with the Breuer-Laine-Piilo measure, we train PPO and SAC agents and benchmark their performance against gradient-based optimal control theory (OCT). While OCT enhances a single dominant backflow peak, RL policies broaden this revival and activate additional contributions in later memory windows, producing sustained positive trace-distance growth over a longer duration. Consequently, the integrated non-Markovianity achieved by RL substantially exceeds that obtained with OCT. These results demonstrate how long-horizon, model-free learning naturally uncovers distributed-backflow strategies and highlight the potential of reinforcement learning for engineering memory effects in open quantum systems."}

Recently, a framework was introduced aiming at extending the thermodynamic formalism to genuine quantum settings, also referred to as autonomous quantum systems: free from external controls, only quantum systems interacting with each other. In this paper, we apply such a thermodynamic framework to common experimental situations of interacting quantum systems. In situations where traditional frameworks detect only heat exchanges, the recent autonomous thermodynamic framework points at work exchanges based on two mechanisms: population inversion and coherence generation / consumption. Such mechanisms are well known in the literature for being related to work expenditure and extraction, in particular in relation with ergotropy, which emphasizes the relevance of the autonomous framework and the limitations of traditional ones. Furthermore, the autonomous framework also identifies a genuine non-unitary mechanism of work exchange related to athermality. %, also pointed out as a resource for work extraction. Finally, in the semi-classical limit, the autonomous framework identifies all energy exchanges as pure work, but distinguishes between local work and interaction energy.\n  Our results show that the autonomous framework provides a refined analysis of work exchange mechanisms in the quantum realm and serves as a consistent approach to analyze thermodynamic processes in realistic quantum devices."}

Using a two-dimensional array of superconducting qubits, we study an interacting spin model at finite temperature in a disordered landscape, tracking dynamics both in real space and in Hilbert space. Over a broad disorder range, we observe an intermediate non-ergodic regime with glass-like characteristics: physical observables become broadly distributed and some, but not all, degrees of freedom are effectively frozen. The Hilbert-space return probability shows slow power-law decay, consistent with finite-temperature quantum glassiness. In the same regime, we detect the onset of a finite Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the disappearance of spin diffusion. By contrast, at lower disorder, spin transport persists with a nonzero diffusion coefficient. Our results show that there is a transition out of the ergodic phase in two-dimensional systems."}

Our cornerstone is the discovery of a ``bond-additive law'', which reveals that the entanglement entropy can be precisely decomposed into a bulk volume-law baseline plus a geometric correction formed by a sum of local contributions from crossed bonds of varying ranges. This law distills complex entanglement landscapes into a concise set of entanglement bond tensions $\\{ω_j\\}$, serving as a quantitative fingerprint of interaction locality. By applying this tomography to Hamiltonian dynamics, random quantum circuits, and Floquet dynamics, we resolve a fundamental distinction between thermalization mechanisms: Hamiltonian thermalized states retain a persistent geometric imprint characterized by a significantly non-zero $ω_1$, while this structure is completely erased in random quantum circuit and Floquet dynamics.

In contrast to many existing quantum linear solvers, our method does not rely on oracle access to query entries, relaxing a key practicality bottleneck. In particular, when the rank of the system of interest is sufficiently small and the rows of the matrix of interest admit an appropriate structure, we achieve circuit complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log m\\right)$, where $m$ is the number of variables and $\\varepsilon$ is the target precision, without dependence on the sparsity $s$, and could possibly be without explicit dependence on condition number $κ$. This shows a significant improvement over previous quantum linear solvers where the dependence on $κ,s$ is at least linear. At the same time, when the rows have an arbitrary structure and have at most $s$ nonzero entries, we obtain the circuit depth $\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\log s\\right)$ using extra $\\mathcal{O}(s)$ ancilla qubits, so the depth grows only logarithmically with sparsity $s$.

Focusing on quantum-specific effects absent from classical data-center evaluations, we analyze how optical-loss-induced Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation delays, coherence-limited entanglement retry windows, and contention from teleportation-based non-local gates shape end-to-end execution performance. Across diverse circuit workloads, we evaluate how architectural properties such as path diversity and path length, and shared BSM (Bell State Measurement) resources interact with optical-switch insertion loss and reconfiguration delay. Our results show that distributed quantum performance is jointly shaped by topology, scheduling policies, and physical-layer parameters, and that these factors interact in nontrivial ways.

Here we introduce an ICO-based QEC protocol, providing the first application of indefinite causal order (ICO) to QEC. By coherently placing auxiliary controls and noisy evolution in an indefinite causal order, the resulting noncommutative interference enables an auxiliary system to herald and correct errors in real time, thereby circumventing the limitations of conventional QEC and restoring HL scaling. We rigorously establish the protocol for single- and multi-noise scenarios and demonstrate its performance in single-qubit, many-body, and continuous-variable platforms. We further identify regimes in which error correction can be implemented entirely by unitary control, without measurements.

Conventional first-order stochastic methods (e.g., Adam) are plagued by slow convergence, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and numerical instability, preventing NQS from reaching the high accuracy required for fundamental science. We address this fundamental optimization bottleneck by introducing the implicitly restarted Lanczos (IRL) method as the core engine for NQS training. Our key innovation is an inherently stable second-order optimization framework that recasts the ill-conditioned parameter update problem into a small, well-posed Hermitian eigenvalue problem. By solving this problem efficiently and robustly with IRL, our approach automatically determines the optimal descent direction and step size, circumventing the need for demanding hyperparameter tuning and eliminating the numerical instabilities common in standard iterative solvers. We demonstrate that IRL enables shallow NQS architectures (with orders of magnitude fewer parameters) to consistently achieve extreme precision (1e-12 kcal/mol) in just 3 to 5 optimization steps. For the F2 molecule, this translates to an approximate 17,900-fold speed-up in total runtime compared to Adam. This work establishes IRL as a superior, robust, and efficient second-order optimization strategy for variational quantum models, paving the way for the practical, high-fidelity application of neural networks in quantum physics and chemistry."}

Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect.Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction.The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range."}

Here, we carry out an in-depth quantum information investigation, deploying two distinct models: The first, semiclassical model can violate the quantum Cramer-Rao bound by several orders of magnitude for weak dissipation and large atom numbers, invalidating the semiclassical approach in this parameter regime. The second model, describing the atoms as a collective spin, respects the Cramer-Rao bound for all parameters. Interestingly, the collective model also predicts Heisenberg scaling for the quantum Fisher information. The comparison of both models shows that Heisenberg scaling is a result of measurement-induced quantum correlation in an otherwise non-interacting quantum system. As the Heisenberg scaling appears in a stationary state of a macroscopic quantum system, it can be thus viewed as a new paradigm in quantum sensing. Intriguingly, the comparison of both models with experimental data can constitute a test for the foundations of quantum mechanics in a macroscopic ensemble of atoms."}

Moreover, the relationship between PINEM and Kapitza-Dirac (KD) effect and nonlinear Compton scattering is still unclear. Here we develop the full quantum theory of electron-photon interaction considering the two-photon process. It is revealed that the emission/absorption of two photons by electrons can be greatly enhanced by manipulating the electric field component of optical near field, and the quantum interference between single-photon and two-photon processes can occur in some circumstances, which affects the photon number state, electron energy states and electron-photon entanglement. Meanwhile, it is found that the KD effect (elastic electron-photon scattering) and nonlinear Compton scattering (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are also a kind of two-photon process and the distribution of electrons can be deduced analytically based on the full quantum theory.

In this work, we provide a theoretical explanation for this phenomenon from a function-class perspective. We show that sufficiently expressive, unstructured variational ansatze enter a Haar-like universality class in which both observable expectation values and parameter gradients concentrate exponentially with system size. As a consequence, the hypothesis class induced by such circuits collapses with high probability to a narrow family of near-constant functions, a phenomenon we term simplicity bias, with barren plateaus arising as a consequence rather than the root cause. Using tools from random matrix theory and concentration of measure, we rigorously characterize this universality class and establish uniform hypothesis-class collapse over finite datasets. We further show that this collapse is not unavoidable: tensor-structured VQCs, including tensor-network-based and tensor-hypernetwork parameterizations, lie outside the Haar-like universality class. By restricting the accessible unitary ensemble through bounded tensor rank or bond dimension, these architectures prevent concentration of measure, preserve output variability for local observables, and retain non-degenerate gradient signals even in over-parameterized regimes. Together, our results unify barren plateaus, expressivity limits, and generalization collapse under a single structural mechanism rooted in random-matrix universality, highlighting the central role of architectural inductive bias in variational quantum algorithms."}

In this analysis, the adjacency matrix of the graph composed by the ground states naturally emerges, and we can predict the eigenvector centralities (one of the node centralities) are related to the probabilities of these states. We verify this prediction on toy models where degeneracy is lifted at first and second order, and we show that second-order weights encode local barrier information, relating sampling fairness to the flatness of the local energy landscape. Finally, this perspective suggests two practical routes toward fair sampling -- promoting connectivity of the graph and reducing heterogeneity of centralities -- and we illustrate consistency with higher-order drivers and minor-embedding transformations."}

We show that this transition probability features a maximum degree of homogeneity in all simple Euclidean Jordan algebras, which includes common finite-dimensional Hilbert space quantum theory. The atomic parts of these algebras or, equivalently, the extreme boundaries of their state spaces can be characterized by purely topological means.

They provide a vital tool for studying quantum randomness and have found broad applications in quantum technologies. However, existing research has focused on discrete ensembles, despite that many physical processes, such as in quantum chaos, thermalization, and control, naturally involve continuous ensembles generated from continuous time-evolution. Here we initial the study of continuous unitary designs, addressing fundamental questions about their construction and practical utility. For single-qubit system, we construct explicit unitary 1-design paths from spherical 2-design curves and Hopf fibration theory. For arbitrary dimensions, we develop two systematic construction frameworks, one based on topological bundle theory of the unitary group and the other based on the Heisenberg-Weyl group. On the practical front, our unitary design paths provide analytical solutions to universally robust quantum control. Simulations show they outperform conventional pulse techniques in mitigating arbitrary unknown static noises, demonstrating immediate utility for quantum engineering. Extending unitary designs to the continuous domain not only introduces powerful geometric and topological tools that complement conventional combinatorial and group-theoretic methods, but also enhances experimental feasibility over discrete counterparts which usually involve instantaneous pulses. As an outlook, we anticipate that this work will pave the way for using continuous unitary designs to explore complex quantum dynamics and devise quantum information protocols."}

However, the unavoidable crosstalk between qubits in current noisy processors impedes the achievement of high gate fidelities and renders full Hilbert-space control optimization prohibitively difficult. Here, we overcome this challenge by reducing the full-system optimization to crosstalk-robust control over constant-sized subsystems, which dramatically reduces the computational cost. Our method effectively eliminates the leading-order gate operation deviations induced by crosstalk, thereby suppressing error rates. Within this framework, we construct analytical pulse solutions for parallel single-qubit gates and numerical pulses for parallel multi-qubit operations. We validate the proposed approach numerically across multiple platforms, including coupled nitrogen-vacancy centers, a nuclear-spin processor, and superconducting-qubit arrays with up to 200 qubits. As a result, the noise scaling is reduced from exponential to linear for parallel single-qubit gates, and an order-of-magnitude reduction is achieved for parallel multi-qubit gates. Moreover, our method does not require precise knowledge of crosstalk strengths and makes no assumption about the underlying qubit connectivity or lattice geometry, thereby establishing a scalable framework for parallel quantum control in large-scale quantum architectures."}

We investigate the question of maximal correlations analogous to the maximally entangled states defined in the entanglement theory of multipartite systems. To formalize this, we employ the sheaf-theoretic framework for contextuality, which generalizes non-locality. This provides a new metric for correlations called contextual fraction (CF), which ranges from 0 (non-contextual) to 1 (maximally contextual). Using this, we have defined the absolutely maximal contextual correlations (AMCC), which are maximally contextual and have maximal marginals, which captures the notion of absolutely maximal entangled (AME) states. The Popescu-Rohrlich (PR) box serves as the bipartite example, and we construct various extensions of such correlations in the tripartite case. An infinite family of various forms of AMCC is constructed using the parity check method and the constraint satisfiability problem (CSP) scheme. We also demonstrate the existence of maximally contextual correlations, which do not exhibit maximal marginals, and refer to them as non-AMCC. The results are further applied to secret sharing and randomness extraction using AMCC correlations."}

It was developed within the LLVM project, which has long powered robust software stacks and enabled compilation across diverse software and hardware components, with particular importance in high-performance computing environments.

Each atom, in an environment of others, exists as a quasiparticle further structuring a bulk medium. In a limit of dilute atomic gas, the dynamics of each atom follows the Mollow-type nonlinear excitation regime, and the medium susceptibility collectivizes the individual atomic responses to the probe mode. We outline how the collective dynamics can be interpolated up to a dense medium, and we argue from general positions that in such a medium the optical nonlinearity and, in particular, its parametric part could be significantly magnified by manipulating both the coherent pump and the sample density. That indicates certain limitations for potential capabilities of quantum communication protocols utilizing the entangled photons, created by a parametric process, as a main resource of quantum correlations."}

Long-lived correlation effects (non-Markovianity), system-environment hybridization, and the necessity for accuracy beyond the Born-Markov approximation form particular challenges. Approaches to meet these challenges have been introduced, originating from different fields, such as hierarchical equations of motion, Lindblad-pseudomode formulas, chain-mapping approaches, quantum Brownian motion master equations, stochastic unravelings, and refined quantum master equations. This diversity, while indicative of the field's relevance, has inadvertently led to a fragmentation that hinders cohesive advances and their effective cross-community application to current problems for complex systems. How are different approaches related to each other? What are their strengths and limitations? Here we give a systematic overview and concise discussion addressing these questions. We make use of a unified framework which very conveniently allows to link different schemes and, this way, may also catalyze further progress. In line with the state of the art, this framework is formulated not in a fully reduced space of the system but in an extended state space which in a minimal fashion includes effective reservoir modes. This in turn offers a comprehensive understanding of existing methods, elucidating their physical interpretations, interconnections, and applicability."}

A promising direction that has made rapid recent progress is to design hardware that has a specific noise profile, leading to a significantly higher threshold for noise with certain quantum error correcting codes. This Perspective focuses on erasure qubits, which enable hardware-efficient quantum error correction, by concatenating an inner code built-in to the hardware with an outer code. We focus on implementations of dual-rail encoded erasure qubits using superconducting qubits, giving an overview of recent developments in theory and simulation, and hardware demonstrators. We also discuss the differences between implementations; near-term applications using quantum error detection; and the open problems for developing this approach towards early fault-tolerant quantum computers."}

Building on this perspective, we develop a general framework for constructing optimization-free, nonlinear incompatibility witnesses based on convex functionals, valid in arbitrary dimensions. We prove that these witnesses are nontrivial precisely when the underlying functional is non-affine on extremal points (e.g., pure states for ensembles). For pure bipartite states, the witnesses yield lower bounds on entanglement measures, thereby outperforming most linear steering inequalities in the pure-state regime. Moreover, the construction extends in full generality to certify measurement and instrument incompatibility, where the witnesses act as genuine incompatibility monotones. We demonstrate the versatility of our approach with two operationally relevant functionals: the Wigner-Yanase skew information and an $\\ell_{2}$-type coherence functional."}

Joshi"], "title": "Topological Obstructions for Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms: Evidence from MaxCut Instances", "comment": "11 pages, 4 figures, 1 table", "summary": "Quantum adiabatic algorithms are commonly analyzed through local spectral properties of an interpolating Hamiltonian, most notably the minimum energy gap. While this perspective captures an important constraint on adiabatic runtimes, it does not fully describe the global structure of spectral evolution in optimization problems with degenerate solution manifolds. In this work, we show that degeneracy alone imposes unavoidable global constraints on spectral flow, even in instances where adiabatic algorithms succeed with high probability. Focusing on digitized quantum adiabatic evolutions, we analyze the eigenphases of the cumulative unitary operator generated along the interpolation path. By explicitly tracking eigenphase trajectories, we demonstrate that multiple spectral bands are forced to interact, braid, and permute before coalescing into a degenerate manifold at the end of the evolution. This global reordering manifests as persistent spectral congestion and nontrivial band permutations that cannot be removed by increasing evolution time or refining the digitization. Using MaxCut instances with controlled degeneracy as a concrete setting, we extract quantitative diagnostics of spectral congestion and explicitly compute the induced band permutations. Our results show that successful adiabatic optimization can coexist with complex and constrained spectral flow, revealing a form of topological obstruction rooted in the global connectivity of eigenstates rather than in local gap closures. These findings highlight intrinsic limitations of gap-based analyses and motivate spectral-flow-based diagnostics for understanding adiabatic algorithms in degenerate optimization landscapes."}

First, we develop the general structure that equivariant maps $Φ:\\mathcal A \\to \\mathcal B$ between $C^\\ast$-algebras satisfy. Then, we undertake a systematic study of unital, Hermiticity-preserving maps that are equivariant under natural unitary group actions. Schwarz maps satisfy Kadison's inequality $Φ(X^\\ast X) \\geq Φ(X)^\\ast Φ(X)$ and form an intermediate class between positive and completely positive maps. We completely classify $U(n)$-equivariant on $M_n(\\mathbb C)$ and determine those that are completely positive and Schwarz. Partial classifications are then obtained for the weaker $DU(n)$-equivariance (diagonal unitary symmetry) and for tensor-product symmetries $U(n_1) \\otimes U(n_2)$. In each case, the parameter regions where $Φ$ is Schwarz or completely positive are described by explicit algebraic inequalities, and their geometry is illustrated. Finally, we further show that the $U(n)$-equivariant family satisfies $\\mathrm{PPT} \\iff \\mathrm{EB}$, while the $DU(2)$, symmetric $DU(3)$, $U(2) \\otimes U(2)$ and $U(2) \\otimes U(3)$, families obey the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ conjecture through a direct symmetry argument. These results reveal how group symmetry controls the structure of non-completely positive maps and provide new concrete examples where the $\\mathrm{PPT}^2$ property holds."}

Supplemental material included", "summary": "Bell inequality tests based on high-dimensional entanglement usually require measurements that can resolve multiple possible outcomes. However, the implementation of high-dimensional multi-outcome measurements is often only emulated via a collection of ``click or no-click'' measurements. This reduction of multi-outcome measurements to binary-outcome measurements opens a loophole in high-dimensional tests Bell inequalities which can be exploited by local hidden variable models [Tavakoli et al., Phys. Rev. A 111, 042433 (2025)]. Here, we close this loophole by using four-dimensional photonic path-mode entanglement and multi-outcome detection. We test both the well-known Collins-Gisin-Linden-Massar-Popescu inequality and a related Bell inequality tailored for maximally entangled states in high-dimension. We observe violations that are large enough to also rule out any quantum model based on entanglement of lower dimension, thereby demonstrating genuinely high-dimensional nonlocality free of the binarisation loophole."}
