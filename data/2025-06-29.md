Abstract: Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum
sensing and networking experiments, including the integration of color centers
into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method
for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method
can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths
of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an
established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a
two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and
reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to
a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We
record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights
about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The
scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar
properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show
that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers
suitable for applications in quantum networking.

Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging
quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of
diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and
charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods
typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state
control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for
continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via
laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking
SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic
mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and
-energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources
of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results
suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host
materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and
surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.

Conclusion: 该接口显著提升了光子收集效率，为量子网络和量子信息处理提供了重要进展。

Abstract: An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key
enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently
controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is
optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and
an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant
photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz
Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the
nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime
measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed
resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 %
per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation
probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the
solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations.
Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the
electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we
generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded
Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.

### [4] [Measurement-based quantum computing with qudit stabilizer states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20724)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于测量的量子计算方法，使用高维量子系统（qudits）和替代资源态（非簇态），通过改变纠缠门实现更高效的量子计算。

Motivation: 探索超越传统簇态的替代资源态，以优化高维量子系统的测量基量子计算效率和复杂性。

Method: 采用对角或块对角Clifford操作作为纠缠门，分析其对资源态和单qudit门的影响，并证明实现任意单qudit酉操作的条件。

Result: 证明了纠缠门的选择直接影响计算复杂度，并提供了qutrit资源态的高效实例。

Conclusion: 通过改变纠缠门，可以实现更高效的量子信息传输和处理，为高维量子计算提供了新的资源态设计思路。

Abstract: We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits
(high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the
cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is
a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual
controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable
consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic
single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum
computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We
prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based
implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for
prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the
realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the
intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different
computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit
resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and
processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required
two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based
quantum computing.

toggling-frame Hamiltonian and the full set of achievable, zeroth-order,
effective Hamiltonians. Examples are included to illustrate the process flow

Conclusion: 非马尔可夫性热源可用于量子通信，如超导或固态自旋量子比特的纠缠。

Abstract: We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement
between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source.
While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when
the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled
steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced.
We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and
identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a
breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect
demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can
be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and
phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered
room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant
superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits
in a phononic quantum channel.

Abstract: Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form
$\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for
\textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to
existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known
about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it
challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In
this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum
differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation
(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a
unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make
several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization
bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme
for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for
oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the
best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art
by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if
state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous
resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the
most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these
findings provide a 110x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes
towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维系统中的贝尔不等式测试面临多结果测量的挑战，传统方法存在二元化漏洞。

Method: 利用双光子纠缠态的联合光谱强度进行多结果测量，克服二元化漏洞。

Result: 在d=8维度下违反CGLMP贝尔不等式，p值可忽略，首次在高维贝尔实验中关闭二元化漏洞。

Conclusion: 仅用频率测量保证非局域相关性，简化了未来高维量子信息协议的实际实现。

Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum
information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell
inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome
measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections
opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit.
Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state
contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this
obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is
contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive
quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or
nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to
dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the
binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing
nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the
technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly
simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum
information protocols.

Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric
top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling
between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational
mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling
with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation
of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent
distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state.
This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for
applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.

Result: 新方法在深隧穿区域表现可靠，但在高温速率理论中存在局限性。

Conclusion: 新非绝热ImF理论改进了现有方法的不足，但仍需进一步优化高温速率理论。

Abstract: Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as
tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different
starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit
of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost
all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a
rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the
flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the
Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous
ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits
correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of
developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in
the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy
the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also
consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory.
We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including
asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the
deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate
theory.

### [11] [Free Electron Paths from Dirac's Wave Equation Elucidating Zitterbewegung and Spin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20857)
*James L Beck*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 狄拉克方程中隐藏的自由电子路径通过速度算符和洛伦兹变换揭示，包含全局惯性中心运动和局部周期性自旋运动（ZBW）。


<details>

Result: 电子在惯性中心周围以光速做周期性运动，产生自旋，与经典电子模型结论一致。

Conclusion: 狄拉克方程直接证实了ZBW现象，与Barut、Hestenes等人的经典模型等价。

Abstract: Despite the widespread belief that Dirac's wave equation does not exhibit
electron paths, they are hiding in plain sight. The worldline of a free
electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function
whose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz
transformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's
global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic
motion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the
ultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\omega_0$ found by Schr\"{o}dinger
in his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the
\emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition
of Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents
are due to the zitter motion. In an inertial "rest"-frame fixed at the inertia
center, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified
direction implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent
perpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius
$c/\omega_0 = \hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to
this spin direction. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin
center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin
center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the
electro-magnetic potential. This analysis confirms the nature of ZBW directly
from Dirac's equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck,
Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical electron models. Furthermore,
these five classical models are equivalent and express the same free electron
dynamics as Dirac's equation.

Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for
the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential
applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum
simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum
phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field
Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce
a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous
wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface
phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated
quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting
quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum
algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields
responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the
system.

eigenvalues of non-Hermitian operators and lays some groundwork for further
exploration of nuclear resonances using quantum computing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子增强模型在金融领域的应用潜力，尤其是板块轮动策略。

Result: 量子模型在训练奖励上表现更优，但在实际投资指标（如累计收益和夏普比率）上不如经典模型。

Conclusion: 当前奖励设计可能导致模型过度拟合短期波动而非优化风险调整收益，未来需改进奖励设计、模型正则化和验证方法。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

Conclusion: 该方法为参数化量子电路的等价性验证提供了可判定的解决方案，并适用于大规模参数化电路。

Abstract: Many promising quantum algorithms in economics, medical science, and material
science rely on circuits that are parameterized by a large number of angles. To
ensure that these algorithms are efficient, these parameterized circuits must
be heavily optimized. However, most quantum circuit optimizers are not
verified, so this procedure is known to be error-prone. For this reason, there
is growing interest in the design of equivalence checking algorithms for
parameterized quantum circuits. In this paper, we define a generalized class of
parameterized circuits with arbitrary rotations and show that this problem is
decidable for cyclotomic gate sets. We propose a cutoff-based procedure which
reduces the problem of verifying the equivalence of parameterized quantum
circuits to the problem of verifying the equivalence of finitely many
parameter-free quantum circuits. Because the number of parameter-free circuits
grows exponentially with the number of parameters, we also propose a
probabilistic variant of the algorithm for cases when the number of parameters
is intractably large. We show that our techniques extend to equivalence modulo
global phase, and describe an efficient angle sampling procedure for cyclotomic
gate sets.

Abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality have been
individually examined through many experiments. In this Letter, we
systematically characterize all of this quantumness in a unified manner. We
first construct universal uncertainty relations to reveal intrinsic features of
incompatible measurements, which include all the state-independent
uncertainties as special cases. We further extend to witness both quantum
coherence and Bell nonlocality. We finally perform experiments with unified
two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell
nonlocality within the experimental error. Our methods for witnessing
quantumness are valuable in characterizing quantum correlations in quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Nonlocality is a key feature of quantum networks and is being studied for its
potential applications in quantum communication and computing. Understanding
and harnessing nonlocality in quantum networks could lead to the development of
faster and more secure communication systems. All the nonclassicalities are
limited to discrete variable quantum networks. We propose the first method to
verify the network nonlocality of all optical quantum network consisting of two
entangled states where one-way classical communication is allowed. This
provides the first device-independent method to verify the quantum correlations
generated from all optical continuous-variable quantum networks.

Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration
of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been
characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on
density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying
quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced,
revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic
systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system
using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a
square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by
observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a
charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy
as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from
the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum
many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication
for advancing quantum simulation techniques.

TL;DR: Transmon qubits can perform Fock state boson sampling, challenging the belief that they are limited to random circuit sampling.


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To demonstrate that transmon qubits can achieve quantum supremacy in Fock state boson sampling, expanding their applications.

Method: Introduces $q$ boson Fock state sampling and maps it to the $q$ boson formalism.

Result: Transmons can effectively perform $q$ boson sampling, achieving quantum supremacy.

Conclusion: This work broadens the potential uses of transmon-based quantum processors and opens new directions in quantum computation.

Abstract: Transmon qubits have traditionally been regarded as limited to random circuit
sampling, incapable of performing Fock state boson sampling, a problem known to
be classically intractable. This work challenges that assumption by introducing
$q$ boson Fock state sampling, a variant in which transmon qubits can operate
effectively. Through direct mapping to the $q$ boson formalism, we demonstrate
that transmons possess the capability to achieve quantum supremacy in $q$ boson
sampling tasks. This finding expands the potential applications of
transmon-based quantum processors and paves the way for new avenues in quantum
computation.

Result: 发现了目前最大的图类支持确定性量子搜索，统一了多种图的算法框架。

Conclusion: 该工作为量子搜索算法提供了更广泛的适用性和确定性保障。

Abstract: Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as
spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum
algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models
and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero
probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design
quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However,
these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where
there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and
elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum
search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian
integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this
work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic
quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search
algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in
previous works, in a unified framework.

Abstract: Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most
profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral)
experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether
gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems.
In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without
requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by
using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when
coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be
generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic
couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational
mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity
superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit
anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational
mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still
qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can
generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores
the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the
quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of
spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local
interactions.

Result: QAGS在基准测试中表现出比传统方法更高的精度，同时在时间和空间复杂度上具有优势。

Conclusion: QAGS是一种高效的全局优化方法，结合量子与经典计算的优势，适用于复杂优化问题。

Abstract: This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method
employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based
on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A
quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate
complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising
regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical
optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates
that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with
controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark
functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher
accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.

Result: 通过AIM参数控制非绝热跃迁，增强了量子电路的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: QSP与AIM的类比为直接实现QSP算法提供了新途径，并利用了快速LZSM量子逻辑门的优势。

Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the
adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast
quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to
perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the
evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We
can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with
nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that
control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$,
frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial
approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy
presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement
the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Result: 在Credit Card、MNIST-5和FMNIST-4数据集上，HaQGNN分类准确率优于现有量子核基线。

Conclusion: 学习型和硬件感知策略在NISQ设备上推进实用量子核设计具有潜力。

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods have emerged as a promising direction in quantum
machine learning (QML), offering a principled way to map classical data into
high-dimensional quantum Hilbert spaces. While conceptually powerful, designing
effective quantum kernels that adapt to both the target task and the
constraints of near-term quantum hardware remains a nontrivial challenge. In
this work, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design framework
that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and graph
neural networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits.
By predicting surrogate metrics related to fidelity and kernel performance,
HaQGNN enables efficient circuit screening at scale. Feature selection is
further incorporated to improve compatibility with limited-qubit systems and
mitigate kernel degradation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
Credit Card, MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms
existing quantum kernel baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our work
highlights the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for
advancing practical quantum kernel design on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: 弱测量形式主义提供了纯希尔伯特空间内的描述，减少了监测干扰。

Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time
quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective
measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based
on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive
monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical
framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental
investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a
generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a
description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results
reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter
between the ancilla and the quantum system.

Abstract: We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which
one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of
photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of
the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate
the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum
information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in
Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering,
absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy
transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs
the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which
determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for
sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction
cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as
optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is
reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast,
at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a
significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two
noninteracting atoms.

Conclusion: 双模腔耦合可优化辐射特性，为超辐射激光设计提供新思路。

Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising
two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic
crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a
time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and
off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we
analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode
photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced
cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance
witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and
absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon
transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral
linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that
an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission
linewidth.

Result: 证明了这些推广形式在数学和操作意义上均存在差异，并提出了一个统一的框架。

Conclusion: 研究为广义测量不兼容性提供了系统框架，并对相关领域的研究具有重要启示。

Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain
observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a
distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and
the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard
incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since
the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement
simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have
only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations
are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely
contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not
only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of
measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations
between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between
these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized
measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results
have for recent works using these different notions.

which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our
approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solution of Schr\"odinger equation of
confined pseudoharmonic potential in presence of a moving boundary condition,
for an arbitrary angular momentum state. It turns out that an important
quantity to probe the problem is internuclear distance ratio, which depends on
the solution of Ermakov equation. The minimum value of time-dependent (TD)
Heisenberg uncertainty product always remains greater than that of the minimum
uncertainty product h/2. The TD average energy is derived analytically in a
closed form and the corresponding average force and average pressure are
defined. Moreover, time correlation function of two states for the case of six
selected diatomic molecules (CO, NO, ScH, CH, H2, N2) is obtained. It is found
to depend on internuclear distance ratio at two different time domains. The TD
survival probability and average life-time of molecule in a confined quantum
system are defined. Expressions are offered for quantum similarity measure,
dissimilarity and quantum similarity index. The latter is given for a pair of
molecules. The obtained results are compared with available literature,
wherever possible. To our knowledge this is the first detailed report of a
non-harmonic central potential in a TD moving boundary condition.

Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent
symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain
is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the
presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated
with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder
leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures
of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in
scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe
these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging
its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We
identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$
symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power
of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body
systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry

Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key
computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics,
chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient
algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting
and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately
satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point
$\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma
-\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling
and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive
numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the
protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the
finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition.
Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of
quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term
quantum processors.

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a

phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves
the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment
of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the
system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase
noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the
constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results
establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated

Abstract: We study the question of how much classical communication is needed when
Alice is given a classical description of a quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for
Bob to recover any expectation value $\langle \psi | M |\psi\rangle$ given an
observable $M$ with $M$ Hermitian and $||M||_{\text{op}} \leq 1$. This task,
whose study was initiated by Raz (ACM 1999) and more recently investigated by
Gosset and Smolin (TQC 2019), can be thought of as a fully classical version of
the pure state case of the well-known classical shadows problem in quantum
learning theory. We show how the hardness of these two seemingly distinct
problems are connected.
  We first consider the relative error version of the communication question
and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ on the one-way
randomized classical communication, improving upon an additive error lower
bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ as shown by Gosset and Smolin. Notably, we show
that this lower bound holds not only for the set of all observables but also
when restricted to just the class of Pauli observables. This fact implies a
$\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ versus $O(\text{poly}(n))$ separation in the compression
size between the relative and additive error settings for non-adaptive Pauli
classical shadows with classical memory.
  Extending this framework, we prove randomized communication lower bounds for
other relative error one-way classical communication tasks: an
$\Omega(2^{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when instead Alice is given an
observable and Bob is given a quantum state and they are asked to estimate the
expectation value, an $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when
restricted to Paulis, and an $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound
when Alice and Bob are both given quantum states and asked to estimate the
inner product.

Abstract: Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an
inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum
mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this
difficulty by developing a quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution
of a second order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz
model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that
has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid
dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and
requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to
the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement
over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up
in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system,
that similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated.
Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that
it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system,
reproducing both regular attractors--limit cycles--and the chaotic attractor
within the chosen parameter regime.

Conclusion: 自然系统中的扰动可能使其更接近量子极限，为分子量子信息技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising
platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical
interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings,
alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion,
typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we
show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a
live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and,
more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance.
Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise
and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that
perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate
closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the
weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the
underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron
spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging
molecular quantum information technologies.

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics with open systems is often based on the quantum
optical weak-coupling master equation or on operational repeated interaction
models, whereas early works on thermalisation and on decoherence theory were
mostly concerned with the kinetics of gas collisions. Here we formulate a
master equation for the dynamics of a quantum system under inelastic scattering
with a dilute thermal gas in three dimensions, comprised of ancilla particles
that also possess internal degrees of freedom. We show thermodynamic
consistency when the gas is at thermal equilibrium, irrespective of whether or
not the ancillas are in resonance with the system. In contrast, when the
internal and the motional state of the gas are thermalised to different
temperatures, the gas acts not as two distinct heat baths, but as a structured
non-equilibrium reservoir that can generate useful energy through uncontrolled
collisions.

Conclusion: 反向传播几何结构为高纯度、可调谐的光子源提供了新途径，适用于量子光子网络。

Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate,
and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among
the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains
one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon
pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating
geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy
filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but
typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation
management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair
source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are
generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to
spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint
spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield
purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves
heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the
platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity,
and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry
offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.

Conclusion: 为高阶时间导数理论提供了一致性重新解释，扩展了构建无鬼量子模型的工具箱。

Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative
theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either
unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory
unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the
spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing
a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from
pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a
non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors
into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show
that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum
bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of
HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.

Motivation: 传统ghost Gutzwiller方法在计算密度矩阵时存在算法瓶颈，需在自洽嵌入循环中收敛，计算成本高。

Method: 结合量子计算机和QSCI算法，利用LUCJ变分量子态和电路切割技术，在量子硬件上实现高效计算。

Result: 在Bethe晶格的Fermi-Hubbard模型中，仅需1%的CI基态即可准确捕捉金属-绝缘体相变。

Conclusion: 混合量子-经典方法有效解决了ghost Gutzwiller的计算瓶颈，为材料模拟提供了高效新途径。

Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve
comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in
simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost.
Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the
density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which
must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid
quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of
embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the
sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We
study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density
of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that
such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as
the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the
performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational
quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on
IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent
to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the
metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe
lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$
of the total CI basis states.

Abstract: We put forth a hitherto unexplored control strategy that enables
high-fidelity fast transport of an unstable quantum wavepacket even in the
presence of bath-induced dissipation. The wavepacket, which is confined within
any shallow (anharmonic) potential trap is steered in acceleration, so as to
maximize the transfer fidelity. This strategy can generally optimize any
non-Markovian bath-dressed continuous-variable system dynamics. It can
simultaneously cope with wavepacket leakage via non-adiabatic transitions and
bath-induced dissipation in an optimal fashion. It can outperform methods based
on counterdiabatic fields (shortcuts to adiabaticity) particularly for fast
non-adiabatic transport. Transport fidelity is maximized even for trajectories
exceeding the speed of bath-excitation propagation, e.g. for supersonic
transfer through phonon baths. This general approach is illustrated for
optimized transfer of impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates. It is applicable
to both dissipative and non-dissipative transfer of trapped atoms and ions and
molecular reaction products.

Conclusion: 研究表明RL在量子最优控制中具有潜力，尤其是在复杂和未知参数环境下。

Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult,
particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in
quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of
the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary
transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter
estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum
optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system
for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a
background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective
measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by
applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL
agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a
transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to
existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against
various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to
investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find
that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as
the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to
generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.

Abstract: Micrometer-scale thin diamond devices are key components for various quantum

into optical microcavities. In this work, we introduce a laser-cutting method
for patterning microdevices from millimeter-sized diamond membranes. The method
can be used to fabricate devices with micrometer thicknesses and edge lengths
of typically 10 $\mu m$ to 100 $\mu m$. We compare this method with an
established nanofabrication process based on electron-beam lithography, a
two-step transfer pattern utilizing a silicon nitride hard mask material, and
reactive ion etching. Microdevices fabricated using both methods are bonded to
a cavity Bragg mirror and characterized using scanning cavity microscopy. We
record two-dimensional cavity finesse maps over the devices, revealing insights
about the variation in diamond thickness, surface quality, and strain. The
scans demonstrate that devices fabricated by laser-cutting exhibit similar
properties to devices obtained by the conventional method. Finally, we show
that the devices host optically coherent Tin- and Nitrogen-Vacancy centers
suitable for applications in quantum networking.

Abstract: Color center spins in diamond nanostructures are a key resource for emerging
quantum technologies. Their innate surface proximity makes precise control of
diamond surface chemistry essential for optimizing their functionality and
charge states. However, conventional surface functionalization methods
typically lack the tunability and efficiency required for robust charge-state
control. Here, we introduce a deterministic, nonvolatile technique for
continuously and efficiently tuning diamond's surface termination via
laser-induced oxidation of H-terminated diamond nanopillars. By tracking
SiV$^-$ photoluminescence as a charge-state proxy, we uncover the microscopic
mechanism of this photocatalytic process through a systematic photon-flux and
-energy analysis, where we identify charge-cycling of native defects as sources
of optically generated holes driving the desired surface oxidation. Our results
suggest that our method applies broadly to other color centers and host
materials, offering a versatile tool for on-demand charge-state control and
surface engineering in solid-state quantum devices.

Abstract: An efficient interface between a spin qubit and single photons is a key
enabling system for quantum science and technology. We report on a coherently
controlled diamond nitrogen-vacancy center electron spin qubit that is
optically interfaced with an open microcavity. Through Purcell enhancement and
an asymmetric cavity design, we achieve efficient collection of resonant
photons, while on-chip microwave lines allow for spin qubit control at a 10 MHz
Rabi frequency. With the microcavity tuned to resonance with the
nitrogen-vacancy center's optical transition, we use excited state lifetime
measurements to determine a Purcell factor of 7.3 $\pm$ 1.6. Upon pulsed
resonant excitation, we find a coherent photon detection probability of 0.5 %
per pulse. Although this result is limited by the finite excitation
probability, it already presents an order of magnitude improvement over the
solid immersion lens devices used in previous quantum network demonstrations.
Furthermore, we use resonant optical pulses to initialize and read out the
electron spin. By combining the efficient interface with spin qubit control, we
generate two-qubit and three-qubit spin-photon states and measure heralded
Z-basis correlations between the photonic time-bin qubits and the spin qubit.

Conclusion: 不同纠缠门导致不同的计算开销，二维资源态几何结构对通用测量基量子计算至关重要。

Abstract: We show how to perform measurement-based quantum computing on qudits
(high-dimensional quantum systems) using alternative resource states beyond the
cluster state. Here, the entangling gate, characterizing the resource state, is
a diagonal or block-diagonal Clifford operation instead of the usual
controlled-phase gate for cluster states. This simple change has remarkable
consequences: the applied entangling operation determines an intrinsic
single-qudit gate associated with the resource that drives the quantum
computation when performing single-qudit measurements on the resource state. We
prove a condition for the intrinsic gate allowing for the measurement-based
implementation of arbitrary single-qudit unitaries. Furthermore, for
prime-power-dimensional qudits, we demonstrate that the complexity of the
realization depends linearly on the dimension and the Pauli order of the
intrinsic gate so that different entangling gates are associated with different
computational overheads. In particular, we provide two examples of qutrit
resource states, which allow more efficient quantum information transport and
processing than the qutrit cluster state. Finally, we discuss the required
two-dimensional geometry of the resource state for universal measurement-based
quantum computing.

Abstract: We describe a novel scheme for the generation of stationary entanglement
between two separated qubits that are driven by a purely thermal photon source.
While in this scenario the qubits remain in a separable state at all times when
the source is broadband, i.e. Markovian, the qubits relax into an entangled
steady state once the bandwidth of the thermal source is sufficiently reduced.
We explain this phenomenon by the appearance of a quasiadiabatic dark state and
identify the most relevant nonadiabatic corrections that eventually lead to a
breakdown of the entangled state, once the temperature is too high. This effect
demonstrates how the non-Markovianity of an otherwise incoherent reservoir can
be harnessed for quantum communication applications in optical, microwave, and
phononic networks. As two specific examples, we discuss the use of filtered
room-temperature noise as a passive resource for entangling distant
superconducting qubits in a cryogenic quantum link or solid-state spin qubits
in a phononic quantum channel.

Abstract: Finding the solution to linear ordinary differential equations of the form
$\partial_t u(t) = -A(t)u(t)$ has been a promising theoretical avenue for
\textit{asymptotic} quantum speedups. However, despite the improvements to
existing quantum differential equation solvers over the years, little is known
about \textit{constant factor} costs of such quantum algorithms. This makes it
challenging to assess the prospects for using these algorithms in practice. In
this work, we prove constant factor bounds for a promising new quantum
differential equation solver, the linear combination of Hamiltonian simulation
(LCHS) algorithm. Our bounds are formulated as the number of queries to a
unitary $U_A$ that block encodes the generator $A$. In doing so, we make
several algorithmic improvements such as tighter truncation and discretization
bounds on the LCHS kernel integral, a more efficient quantum compilation scheme
for the SELECT operator in LCHS, as well as use of a constant-factor bound for
oblivious amplitude amplification, which may be of general interest. To the
best of our knowledge, our new formulae improve over previous state of the art
by at least two orders of magnitude, where the speedup can be far greater if
state preparation has a significant cost. Accordingly, for any previous
resource estimates of time-independent linear differential equations for the
most general case whereby the dynamics are not \textit{fast-forwardable}, these
findings provide a 110x reduction in runtime costs. This analysis contributes
towards establishing more promising applications for quantum computing.

Motivation: 高维系统中的贝尔不等式测试面临多结果测量的实现挑战，传统方法可能被局部隐变量理论利用。

Method: 利用双光子纠缠态的联合光谱强度进行多结果测量，以克服二元化漏洞。

Result: 在维度d=8时违反CGLMP贝尔不等式，p值可忽略，首次关闭了高维贝尔实验中的二元化漏洞。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了高维量子信息协议的实现，无需时间域测量技术。

Abstract: Violation of Bell inequalities is an essential requirement for many quantum
information and communication protocols. In high-dimensional systems, Bell
inequality tests face the challenge of implementing genuinely multi-outcome
measurements, since the emulation of these with separate dichotomic projections
opens a binarisation loophole that local hidden variable theories can exploit.
Here we show that the joint spectral intensity of a two-photon entangled state
contains access to the necessary multi-outcome measurements to overcome this
obstacle and certify nonlocality for high-dimensional states. This result is
contrary to the belief that the joint spectral intensity is a phase-insensitive
quantity and does not have sufficient information to certify entanglement or
nonlocality. Using this approach, we violate the CGLMP Bell inequality up to
dimension d = 8, all with negligible p-values, and for the first time close the
binarisation loophole in high-dimensional Bell experiments. Guaranteeing
nonlocal correlations using frequency-only measurements removes the
technological hurdle of measurements in the temporal domain, thus greatly
simplifying any practical implementation of future high-dimensional quantum
information protocols.

Abstract: We suggest a protocol for the sympathetic cooling of a molecular asymmetric
top rotor co-trapped with laser-cooled atomic ions,based on resonant coupling
between the molecular ion's electric dipole moment and a common vibrational
mode of the trapped particles. By combining sympathetic sideband laser cooling
with coherent microwave excitation, we demonstrate the efficient depopulation
of arbitrary rotational subspaces and the ability to cool an incoherent
distribution of rotational states into a single, well-defined quantum state.
This capability opens the door to exploiting the rotational Hilbert space for
applications in quantum information processing and high-precision spectroscopy.

Abstract: Semiclassical instanton theory captures nuclear quantum effects such as
tunnelling in chemical reactions. It was originally derived from two different
starting points, the flux correlation function and the ImF premise. In pursuit
of a nonadiabatic rate theory, a number of methods have been proposed; almost
all based on the less rigorous ImF premise. Only recently, we introduced a
rigorous nonadiabatic ring-polymer instanton rate theory in the
flux-correlation function framework which successfully bridges from the
Born-Oppenheimer to the golden-rule limit. Here, we examine the previous
ImF-based attempts and conclude that they do not capture the two limits
correctly. In particular, we will highlight how the last in a series of
developments, called mean-field ring-polymer instanton theory, breaks down in
the golden-rule limit. We develop a new nonadiabatic ImF rate theory to remedy
the failings of previous attempts while taking inspiration from them. We also
consider the crossover from deep tunnelling to a high-temperature rate theory.
We test our new nonadiabatic ImF theory on a range of models including
asymmetric and multidimensional systems and we show reliable results for the
deep-tunnelling regime but limitations for the related high-temperature rate
theory.

Conclusion: 狄拉克方程直接揭示了zitter运动的本质，与多种经典电子模型等效，统一了自由电子的动力学描述。

Abstract: Despite the widespread belief that Dirac's wave equation does not exhibit
electron paths, they are hiding in plain sight. The worldline of a free
electron is revealed by applying Dirac's velocity operator to its wave function
whose space-time arguments are expressed in a proper time by a Lorentz
transformation. This motion can be decomposed into two parts: the electron's
global motion of its inertia (or spin) center and an inherent local periodic
motion about this point that produces the electron's spin. The latter has the
ultra-high ZBW (zitterbewegung) frequency $\omega_0$ found by Schr\"{o}dinger
in his operator analysis of Dirac's equation and so is appropriately called the
\emph{zitter motion}. The decomposition corresponds to Gordon's decomposition
of Dirac's current where the so-called polarization and magnetization currents
are due to the zitter motion. In an inertial "rest"-frame fixed at the inertia
center, Dirac's wave function corresponding to the electron spin in a specified
direction implies that a free electron of mass $m$ moves in an inherent
perpetual zitter motion at the speed of light $c$ in a circle of radius
$c/\omega_0 = \hbar /(2mc)$ about the inertia center in a plane orthogonal to
this spin direction. The electron continuously accelerates about the spin
center without any external force because the inertia is effective at the spin
center, rather than at its charge center where the electron interacts with the
electro-magnetic potential. This analysis confirms the nature of ZBW directly
from Dirac's equation, agreeing with the conclusions of Barut and Zanghi, Beck,
Hestenes, Rivas and Salesi from their classical electron models. Furthermore,
these five classical models are equivalent and express the same free electron
dynamics as Dirac's equation.

Abstract: The characterization of quantum phase transitions is a fundamental task for
the understanding of quantum phases of matter, with a number of potential
applications in quantum technologies. In this work, we use digital quantum
simulation as a resource to theoretically and experimentally study quantum
phase transitions. More specifically, we implement the variational quantum
eigensolver (VQE) algorithm to the one-dimensional spin-$1/2$ transverse-field
Ising chain in the presence of boundary magnetic fields. Such fields can induce
a rich phase diagram, including a first-order line and also a continuous
wetting transition, which is a quantum version of the classical wetting surface
phenomenon. We present results for noiseless simulations of the associated
quantum circuits as well as hardware results taken from a superconducting
quantum processor. For different regions of the phase diagram, the quantum
algorithm allows us to predict the critical value of the magnetic fields
responsible for either the first or second-order transitions occuring in the
system.

Conclusion: 当前奖励设计可能导致过拟合短期波动，量子电路在NISQ约束下的表达能力和优化不稳定性加剧了这一问题，未来需改进奖励设计和模型正则化。

Abstract: We propose a hybrid quantum-classical reinforcement learning framework for
sector rotation in the Taiwan stock market. Our system employs Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) as the backbone algorithm and integrates both classical
architectures (LSTM, Transformer) and quantum-enhanced models (QNN, QRWKV,
QASA) as policy and value networks. An automated feature engineering pipeline
extracts financial indicators from capital share data to ensure consistent
model input across all configurations. Empirical backtesting reveals a key
finding: although quantum-enhanced models consistently achieve higher training
rewards, they underperform classical models in real-world investment metrics
such as cumulative return and Sharpe ratio. This discrepancy highlights a core
challenge in applying reinforcement learning to financial domains -- namely,
the mismatch between proxy reward signals and true investment objectives. Our
analysis suggests that current reward designs may incentivize overfitting to
short-term volatility rather than optimizing risk-adjusted returns. This issue
is compounded by the inherent expressiveness and optimization instability of
quantum circuits under Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) constraints. We
discuss the implications of this reward-performance gap and propose directions
for future improvement, including reward shaping, model regularization, and
validation-based early stopping. Our work offers a reproducible benchmark and
critical insights into the practical challenges of deploying quantum
reinforcement learning in real-world finance.

Abstract: Many promising quantum algorithms in economics, medical science, and material
science rely on circuits that are parameterized by a large number of angles. To
ensure that these algorithms are efficient, these parameterized circuits must
be heavily optimized. However, most quantum circuit optimizers are not
verified, so this procedure is known to be error-prone. For this reason, there
is growing interest in the design of equivalence checking algorithms for
parameterized quantum circuits. In this paper, we define a generalized class of
parameterized circuits with arbitrary rotations and show that this problem is
decidable for cyclotomic gate sets. We propose a cutoff-based procedure which
reduces the problem of verifying the equivalence of parameterized quantum
circuits to the problem of verifying the equivalence of finitely many
parameter-free quantum circuits. Because the number of parameter-free circuits
grows exponentially with the number of parameters, we also propose a
probabilistic variant of the algorithm for cases when the number of parameters
is intractably large. We show that our techniques extend to equivalence modulo
global phase, and describe an efficient angle sampling procedure for cyclotomic
gate sets.

Abstract: Heisenberg's uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell nonlocality have been
individually examined through many experiments. In this Letter, we
systematically characterize all of this quantumness in a unified manner. We
first construct universal uncertainty relations to reveal intrinsic features of
incompatible measurements, which include all the state-independent
uncertainties as special cases. We further extend to witness both quantum
coherence and Bell nonlocality. We finally perform experiments with unified
two-photon states, and validate the uncertainty principle, coherence and Bell
nonlocality within the experimental error. Our methods for witnessing
quantumness are valuable in characterizing quantum correlations in quantum
information processing.

Abstract: Quantum simulators offer a new opportunity for the experimental exploration
of non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics, which have traditionally been
characterized through expectation values or entanglement measures, based on
density matrices of the system. Recently, a more general framework for studying
quantum many-body systems based on projected ensembles has been introduced,
revealing novel quantum phenomena, such as deep thermalization in chaotic
systems. Here, we experimentally investigate a chaotic quantum many-body system
using projected ensembles on a superconducting processor with 16 qubits on a
square lattice. Our results provide direct evidence of deep thermalization by
observing a Haar-distributed projected ensemble for the steady states within a
charge-conserved sector. Moreover, by introducing an ensemble-averaged entropy
as a metric, we establish a benchmark for many-body information leakage from
the system to its environment. Our work paves the way for studying quantum
many-body dynamics using projected ensembles and shows a potential implication
for advancing quantum simulation techniques.

Motivation: To demonstrate that transmon qubits can achieve quantum supremacy in $q$ boson sampling tasks, expanding their applications.

Abstract: Searching for an unknown marked vertex on a given graph (also known as
spatial search) is an extensively discussed topic in the area of quantum
algorithms, with a plethora of results based on different quantum walk models
and targeting various types of graphs. Most of these algorithms have a non-zero
probability of failure. In recent years, there have been some efforts to design
quantum spatial search algorithms with $100\%$ success probability. However,
these works either only work for very special graphs or only for the case where
there is only one marked vertex. In this work, we propose a different and
elegant approach to quantum spatial search, obtaining deterministic quantum
search algorithms that can find a marked vertex with certainty on any Laplacian
integral graph with any predetermined proportion of marked vertices. Thus, this
work discovers the largest class of graphs so far that allow deterministic
quantum search, making it easy to design deterministic quantum search
algorithms for many graphs, including the different graphs discussed in
previous works, in a unified framework.

Abstract: Reconciling quantum mechanics and general relativity remains one of the most
profound challenges in modern physics. The BMV (Bose-Marletto-Vedral)
experiment can assess the quantum nature of gravity by testing whether
gravitational interactions can generate entanglement between quantum systems.
In this work, we show that entanglement can be generated by gravity without
requiring spacetime superpositions or quantum spacetime degrees of freedom by
using mediators that do not satisfy the usual property of local tomography when
coupling to quantum matter. Specifically, we showcase how entanglement can be
generated using three distinct toy models that display non-locally tomographic
couplings between quantum matter and a locally classical gravitational
mediator. These models include (i) fermionic systems with the parity
superselection rule, (ii) non-Abelian anyonic systems, and (iii) a novel bit
anti-bit model. Our results demonstrate a crucial point: a gravitational
mediator which does not exhibit superpositions of its classical basis but still
qualifies as non-classical via non-locally tomographic coupling mechanisms can
generate entanglement through local interactions. This work also underscores
the importance of relaxing local tomography in exploring the
quantum-gravitational interface. It provides a novel perspective on the role of
spacetime degrees of freedom in entanglement generation through local
interactions.

Abstract: This work presents Quantum Adaptive Search (QAGS), a hybrid quantum-classical
algorithm for the global optimization of multivariate functions. The method
employs an adaptive mechanism that dynamically narrows the search space based
on a quantum-estimated probability distribution of the objective function. A
quantum state encodes information about solution quality through an appropriate
complex amplitude mapping, enabling the identification of the most promising
regions, and thus progressively tightening the search bounds; then a classical
optimizer performs local refinement of the solution. The analysis demonstrates
that QAGS ensures a contraction of the search space toward global optima, with
controlled computational complexity. The numerical results on the benchmark
functions show that, compared to the classical methods, QAGS achieves higher
accuracy while offering advantages in both time and space complexity.

Method: 将QSP参数映射到AIM，通过控制驱动振幅、频率和信号时序等参数实现多项式近似。

Result: 通过类比QSP与AIM，实现了快速LZSM量子逻辑门，并获得其所有优势。

Conclusion: QSP与AIM的类比为直接实现QSP算法提供了一种有效途径，并增强了量子电路的性能。

Abstract: Here we investigate analogy between quantum signal processing (QSP) and the
adiabatic-impulse model (AIM) in order to implement the QSP algorithm with fast
quantum logic gates. QSP is an algorithm that uses single-qubit dynamics to
perform a polynomial function transformation. AIM effectively describes the
evolution of a two-level quantum system under strong external driving field. We
can map parameters from QSP to AIM to implement QSP-like evolution with
nonadiabatic, high-amplitude external drives. By choosing AIM parameters that
control non-adiabatic transition parameters (such as driving amplitude $A$,
frequency $\omega$, and signal timing), one can achieve polynomial
approximations and increase robustness in quantum circuits. The analogy
presented here between QSP and AIM can be useful as a way to directly implement
the QSP algorithm on quantum systems and obtain all the benefits from the fast
Landau-Zener-Stuckelberg-Majotana (LZSM) quantum logic gates.

Abstract: Quantum kernel methods have emerged as a promising direction in quantum
machine learning (QML), offering a principled way to map classical data into
high-dimensional quantum Hilbert spaces. While conceptually powerful, designing
effective quantum kernels that adapt to both the target task and the
constraints of near-term quantum hardware remains a nontrivial challenge. In
this work, we propose HaQGNN, a hardware-aware quantum kernel design framework
that integrates quantum device topology, noise characteristics, and graph
neural networks (GNNs) to evaluate and select task-relevant quantum circuits.
By predicting surrogate metrics related to fidelity and kernel performance,
HaQGNN enables efficient circuit screening at scale. Feature selection is
further incorporated to improve compatibility with limited-qubit systems and
mitigate kernel degradation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets,
Credit Card, MNIST-5, and FMNIST-4, demonstrate that HaQGNN outperforms
existing quantum kernel baselines in terms of classification accuracy. Our work
highlights the potential of learning-based and hardware-aware strategies for
advancing practical quantum kernel design on NISQ devices.

Conclusion: 弱重现的修改形式在量子系统的希尔伯特空间内提供了纯描述。

Abstract: We study the first detected recurrence time problem of continuous-time
quantum walks on graphs. While previous works have employed projective
measurements to determine the first return time, we implement a protocol based
on weak measurements on a dilated system, enabling minimally invasive
monitoring throughout the evolution. To achieve this, we extend the theoretical
framework and complement it with both numerical simulations and experimental
investigations on an IBM quantum computer. Despite the implementation of a
generalized measurement, our modified formalism of weak recurrence provides a
description purely within the Hilbert space of the quantum system. Our results
reveal that the first hitting time scales inversely with the coupling parameter
between the ancilla and the quantum system.

Conclusion: 通过调控泵浦和间距，可以灵活控制双原子系统的光学响应，为量子信息处理提供新途径。

Abstract: We study the optical response of a binary system of identical atoms in which
one of them is excited by an incoherent pump. %We study the properties of
photon scattering, absorption and emission, together with the time evolution of
the atomic system. %This allows us to characterize and eventually manipulate
the state of the system, paving the way for prospective applications in quantum
information processing. Applying the diagrammatic formalism developed in
Donaire [Phys. Rev. A104, 043704 (2021)], it is shown how scattering,
absorption, stimulated emission, spontaneous emission and resonant energy
transfer can be tailored by varying i) the interatomic distance, which governs
the interference effects of the emitted radiation; and ii) the pump rate, which
determines the population of the atomic levels. It is found that, for
sufficiently strong pumping, the collective component of the extinction
cross-section becomes negligible, regardless of the interatomic distance, as
optical gains compensate for losses, and the total extinction cross-section is
reduced to less than half of its value in the absence of pumping. In contrast,
at weak pumping and short interatomic distances, interference effects lead to a
significant suppression of the extinction cross-section relative to that of two
noninteracting atoms.

Abstract: We propose a scheme for two-mode hyperradiant lasing in a system comprising
two incoherently pumped quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a bimodal photonic
crystal cavity. To account for the exciton-phonon interactions, we employ a
time-convolutionless polaron-transformed master equation. Both resonant and
off-resonant couplings of the QDs to the cavity modes are considered, and we
analyze the resulting radiance witness as well as the intra- and inter-mode
photon correlations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phonon-induced
cooperative two-mode two-photon processes significantly enhance the radiance
witness. This enhancement is quantified by evaluating the emission and
absorption rates associated with both single-mode and two-mode two-photon
transitions. Finally, we compare the radiance witness and emission spectral
linewidths for QDs coupled to single-mode and bimodal cavities, revealing that
an increase in radiance witness is accompanied by a narrowing of the emission
linewidth.

Result: 证明了这些推广形式在操作意义和数学描述上均存在差异，并形成了一个严格的层次结构。

Conclusion: 研究为广义测量不兼容性提供了一个统一框架，并对相关研究提供了理论支持。

Abstract: The incompatibility of quantum measurements, i.e. the fact that certain
observable quantities cannot be measured jointly is widely regarded as a
distinctive quantum feature with important implications for the foundations and
the applications of quantum information theory. While the standard
incompatibility of multiple measurements has been the focus of attention since
the inception of quantum theory, its generalizations, such as measurement
simulability, $n$-wise incompatibility, and mulit-copy incompatibility have
only been proposed recently. Here, we point out that all these generalizations
are differing notions of the question of how many measurements are genuinely
contained in a measurement device. We then show, that all notions do differ not
only in their operational meaning but also mathematically in the set of
measurement assemblages they describe. We then fully resolve the relations
between these different generalizations, by showing a strict hierarchy between
these notions. Hence, we provide a general framework for generalized
measurement incompatibility. Finally, we consider the implications our results
have for recent works using these different notions.

which leads to a natural protocol to efficiently grow them. We explain how our
approach can be adapted to other quantum computing hardware.

Abstract: In this work, we present analytical solution of Schr\"odinger equation of
confined pseudoharmonic potential in presence of a moving boundary condition,
for an arbitrary angular momentum state. It turns out that an important
quantity to probe the problem is internuclear distance ratio, which depends on
the solution of Ermakov equation. The minimum value of time-dependent (TD)
Heisenberg uncertainty product always remains greater than that of the minimum
uncertainty product h/2. The TD average energy is derived analytically in a
closed form and the corresponding average force and average pressure are
defined. Moreover, time correlation function of two states for the case of six
selected diatomic molecules (CO, NO, ScH, CH, H2, N2) is obtained. It is found
to depend on internuclear distance ratio at two different time domains. The TD
survival probability and average life-time of molecule in a confined quantum
system are defined. Expressions are offered for quantum similarity measure,
dissimilarity and quantum similarity index. The latter is given for a pair of
molecules. The obtained results are compared with available literature,
wherever possible. To our knowledge this is the first detailed report of a
non-harmonic central potential in a TD moving boundary condition.

Conclusion: Rydberg平台为研究量子多体系统中的对称性涌现提供了强大工具，揭示了约束、几何和临界性的相互作用。

Abstract: The Ising model serves as a canonical platform for exploring emergent
symmetry in quantum critical systems. The critical point of the 1D Ising chain
is described by a conformal Ising field theory, which remains integrable in the
presence of a magnetic perturbation leading to massive particles associated
with the exceptional Lie algebra $E_8$. Coupling two Ising chains in a ladder
leads to an even richer $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$ symmetry. Experimental signatures
of the associated particle excitations have arguably been observed in
scattering studies of the spin chain material CoNb$_2$O$_6$. Here, we probe
these emergent symmetries in a Rydberg atom quantum processing unit, leveraging
its tunable geometry to realize both chain and ladder configurations. We
identify mass spectra consistent with $E_8$ and $\mathcal{D}^{(1)}_8$
symmetries at the respective critical points. Our results demonstrate the power
of Rydberg platforms for investigating symmetry emergence in quantum many-body
systems and provide a direct window into the interplay of confinement, geometry
and criticality.

Abstract: Preparation of quantum thermal states of many-body systems is a key
computational challenge for quantum processors, with applications in physics,
chemistry, and classical optimization. We provide a simple and efficient
algorithm for thermal state preparation, combining engineered bath resetting
and modulated system-bath coupling to derive a quantum channel approximately
satisfying quantum detailed balance relations. We show that the fixed point
$\hat\sigma$ of the channel approximates the Gibbs state as $\|\hat\sigma
-\hat\sigma_\beta\|\sim \theta^2$, where $\theta$ is the system-bath coupling
and $\hat\sigma_\beta \propto e^{-\beta \hat H_S}$. We provide extensive
numerics, for the example of the 2D Quantum Ising model, confirming that the
protocol successfully prepares the thermal state throughout the
finite-temperature phase diagram, including near the quantum phase transition.
Our algorithm provides a path to efficient quantum simulation of
quantum-correlated states at finite temperature with current and near-term
quantum processors.

Abstract: We demonstrate coherent, measurement-free optical feedback control of a
levitated nanoparticle, achieving phonon occupations down to a few hundred
phonons. Unlike measurement-based feedback, this all-optical scheme preserves
the correlations between mechanical motion and the feedback signal. Adjustment
of the feedback phase and delay provides precise and tunable control over the
system dynamics. The ultimate cooling performance is currently limited by phase
noise, which we analyze within a theoretical framework that outlines the
constraints and prospects for reaching the motional ground state. Our results
establish coherent feedback as a powerful tool for quantum control of levitated
systems, extending beyond center-of-mass cooling.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了相对误差与加性误差在压缩大小上的显著差异，为量子学习理论提供了新的见解。

Abstract: We study the question of how much classical communication is needed when
Alice is given a classical description of a quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ for
Bob to recover any expectation value $\langle \psi | M |\psi\rangle$ given an
observable $M$ with $M$ Hermitian and $||M||_{\text{op}} \leq 1$. This task,
whose study was initiated by Raz (ACM 1999) and more recently investigated by
Gosset and Smolin (TQC 2019), can be thought of as a fully classical version of
the pure state case of the well-known classical shadows problem in quantum
learning theory. We show how the hardness of these two seemingly distinct
problems are connected.
  We first consider the relative error version of the communication question
and prove a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ on the one-way
randomized classical communication, improving upon an additive error lower
bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ as shown by Gosset and Smolin. Notably, we show
that this lower bound holds not only for the set of all observables but also
when restricted to just the class of Pauli observables. This fact implies a
$\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}})$ versus $O(\text{poly}(n))$ separation in the compression
size between the relative and additive error settings for non-adaptive Pauli
classical shadows with classical memory.
  Extending this framework, we prove randomized communication lower bounds for
other relative error one-way classical communication tasks: an
$\Omega(2^{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when instead Alice is given an
observable and Bob is given a quantum state and they are asked to estimate the
expectation value, an $\Omega(\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound when
restricted to Paulis, and an $\Omega(\sqrt{2^{n}}\epsilon^{-2})$ lower bound
when Alice and Bob are both given quantum states and asked to estimate the
inner product.

Abstract: Simulating nonlinear classical dynamics on a quantum computer is an
inherently challenging task due to the linear operator formulation of quantum
mechanics. In this work, we provide a systematic approach to alleviate this
difficulty by developing a quantum algorithm that implements the time evolution
of a second order time-discretized version of the Lorenz model. The Lorenz
model is a celebrated system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations that
has been extensively studied in the contexts of climate science, fluid
dynamics, and chaos theory. Our algorithm possesses a recursive structure and
requires only a linear number of copies of the initial state with respect to
the number of integration time-steps. This provides a significant improvement
over previous approaches, while preserving the characteristic quantum speed-up
in terms of the dimensionality of the underlying differential equations system,
that similar time-marching quantum algorithms have previously demonstrated.
Notably, by classically implementing the proposed algorithm, we showcase that
it accurately captures the structural characteristics of the Lorenz system,
reproducing both regular attractors--limit cycles--and the chaotic attractor
within the chosen parameter regime.

Conclusion: 自然系统中的扰动可能帮助其更接近量子极限，为分子量子信息技术提供了新思路。

Abstract: Magnetosensitive spin-correlated radical-pairs (SCRPs) offer a promising
platform for noise-robust quantum metrology. However, unavoidable interradical
interactions, such as electron-electron dipolar and exchange couplings,
alongside deleterious perturbations resulting from intrinsic radical motion,
typically degrade their potential as magnetometers. In contrast to this, we
show how structured molecular motion modulating interradical interactions in a
live chemical sensor in cryptochrome can, in fact, increase sensitivity and,
more so, push precision in estimating magnetic field directions closer to the
quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound, suggesting near-optimal metrological performance.
Remarkably, this approach to optimality is amplified under environmental noise
and persists with increasing complexity of the spin system, suggesting that
perturbations inherent to such natural systems have enabled them to operate
closer to the quantum limit to more effectively extract information from the
weak geomagnetic field. This insight opens the possibility of channeling the
underlying physical principles of motion-induced modulation of electron
spin-spin interactions towards devising efficient handles over emerging
molecular quantum information technologies.

Abstract: Quantum thermodynamics with open systems is often based on the quantum
optical weak-coupling master equation or on operational repeated interaction
models, whereas early works on thermalisation and on decoherence theory were
mostly concerned with the kinetics of gas collisions. Here we formulate a
master equation for the dynamics of a quantum system under inelastic scattering
with a dilute thermal gas in three dimensions, comprised of ancilla particles
that also possess internal degrees of freedom. We show thermodynamic
consistency when the gas is at thermal equilibrium, irrespective of whether or
not the ancillas are in resonance with the system. In contrast, when the
internal and the motional state of the gas are thermalised to different
temperatures, the gas acts not as two distinct heat baths, but as a structured
non-equilibrium reservoir that can generate useful energy through uncontrolled
collisions.

Abstract: Quantum photonic technologies rely on the ability to generate, manipulate,
and interfere indistinguishable single photons on a scalable platform. Among
the various approaches, spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) remains
one of the most widely used methods for generating entangled or pure photon
pairs. However most integrated SPDC sources relying on co-propagating
geometries have a limited purity of heralded photons, or require lossy
filtering. Type-2 SPDC processes can produce pure separable photons but
typically suffer from lower efficiency and added complexity due to polarisation
management. Here we show the first integrated counter-propagating photon-pair
source on lithium niobate on insulator, where signal and idler photons are
generated in opposite directions. The counter-propagating geometry leads to
spectrally uncorrelated photon pairs without spectral filtering. The joint
spectral intensity measurements and unheralded $g^{(2)}$ correlations, yield
purities of (92$\pm$3)%. Interference between two independent sources achieves
heralded visibilities of (71$\pm$3)%, confirming the scalability of the
platform. These results establish a new route toward integrated, high-purity,
and tunable photon sources. The demonstrated counter-propagating geometry
offers a scalable solution for quantum photonic networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高阶时间导数理论中量化通常导致无界谱或不可归一化本征态，使理论不物理。

Conclusion: 该方法为高阶时间导数理论提供了一致性重新解释，扩展了构建无幽灵量子模型的工具箱。

Abstract: We address the long-standing ``ghost problem" in higher time-derivative
theories (HTDTs), where quantisation typically yields sectors with either
unbounded spectra or non-normalisable eigenstates; both rendering the theory
unphysical. We propose a novel method that preserves the bounded nature of the
spectrum in one particular sector while restoring normalisability by employing
a non-unitary similarity transformation. Inspired by techniques from
pseudo/quasi-Hermitian PT-symmetric quantum mechanics, we construct a
non-unitary map between two Hermitian Hamiltonians, converting ghostly sectors
into physically viable ones. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach
using a concrete HTDT model, related to the Pais-Uhlenbeck oscillator, and show
that the transformed system admits normalisable eigenstates and a spectrum
bounded from below. This framework offers a consistent re-interpretation of
HTDTs and extends the toolbox for constructing ghost-free quantum models.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种混合量子-经典gGut技术，利用量子计算机计算嵌入哈密顿量的基态性质，显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统gGut方法在计算密度矩阵时存在算法瓶颈，需要一种更高效的方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用量子选择的配置相互作用（QSCI）算法，结合局部酉簇Jastrow（LUCJ）变分量子态和电路切割技术。

Result: 在IQM量子硬件上成功模拟了11个幽灵轨道（24量子比特）的系统，并正确捕捉了Fermi-Hubbard模型中的金属-绝缘体相变。

Conclusion: QSCI方法在稀疏基态下高效，为gGut技术提供了可行的量子计算解决方案。

Abstract: The ghost Gutzwiller ansatz (gGut) embedding technique was shown to achieve
comparable accuracy to the gold standard dynamical mean-field theory method in
simulating real material properties, yet at a much lower computational cost.
Despite that, gGut is limited by the algorithmic bottleneck of computing the
density matrix of the underlying effective embedding model, a quantity which
must be converged within a self-consistent embedding loop. We develop a hybrid
quantum-classical gGut technique which computes the ground state properties of
embedding Hamiltonians with the help of a quantum computer, using the
sample-based quantum-selected configuration interaction (QSCI) algorithm. We
study the applicability of SCI-based methods to the evaluation of the density
of states for single-band Anderson impurity models within gGut and find that
such ground states of interest become sufficiently sparse in the CI basis as
the number of ghost orbitals is increased. Further, we investigate the
performance of QSCI using local unitary cluster Jastrow (LUCJ) variational
quantum states in combination with a circuit cutting technique, prepared on
IQM's quantum hardware for system sizes of up to 11 ghost orbitals, equivalent
to 24 qubits. We report converged gGut calculations which correctly capture the
metal-to-insulator phase transition in the Fermi-Hubbard model on the Bethe
lattice by using quantum samples to build an SCI basis with as little as $1\%$
of the total CI basis states.

Conclusion: 该策略适用于玻色-爱因斯坦凝聚中的杂质传输，以及原子、离子和分子反应产物的传输。

Abstract: We put forth a hitherto unexplored control strategy that enables
high-fidelity fast transport of an unstable quantum wavepacket even in the
presence of bath-induced dissipation. The wavepacket, which is confined within
any shallow (anharmonic) potential trap is steered in acceleration, so as to
maximize the transfer fidelity. This strategy can generally optimize any
non-Markovian bath-dressed continuous-variable system dynamics. It can
simultaneously cope with wavepacket leakage via non-adiabatic transitions and
bath-induced dissipation in an optimal fashion. It can outperform methods based
on counterdiabatic fields (shortcuts to adiabaticity) particularly for fast
non-adiabatic transport. Transport fidelity is maximized even for trajectories
exceeding the speed of bath-excitation propagation, e.g. for supersonic
transfer through phonon baths. This general approach is illustrated for
optimized transfer of impurities in Bose-Einstein condensates. It is applicable
to both dissipative and non-dissipative transfer of trapped atoms and ions and
molecular reaction products.

Abstract: Quantum optimal control in the presence of decoherence is difficult,
particularly when not all Hamiltonian parameters are known precisely, as in
quantum sensing applications. In this context, maximizing the sensitivity of
the system is the objective, for which the optimal target state or unitary
transformations are unknown, especially in the case of multi-parameter
estimation. Here, we investigate the use of reinforcement learning (RL),
specifically the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, for problems in quantum
optimal control. We adopt a spin-based magnetometer as a benchmarking system
for the efficacy of the SAC algorithm. In such systems, the magnitude of a
background magnetic field acting on a spin can be determined via projective
measurements. The precision of the determined magnitude can be optimized by
applying pulses of transverse fields with different strengths. We train an RL
agent on numerical simulations of the spin system to determine a
transverse-field pulse sequence that optimizes the precision and compare it to
existing sensing strategies. We evaluate the agent's performance against
various Hamiltonian parameters, including values not seen in training, to
investigate the agent's ability to generalize to different situations. We find
that the RL agents are sensitive to certain parameters of the system, such as
the pulse duration and the purity of the initial state, but overall are able to
generalize well, supporting the use of RL in quantum optimal control settings.
