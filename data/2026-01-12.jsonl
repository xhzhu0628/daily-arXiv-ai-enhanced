Benchmarking results for IonQ Forte-1, Rigetti Ankaa-3, and IQM Garnet", "summary": "Cloud-accessible quantum processors enable direct execution of quantum algorithms on heterogeneous hardware platforms. Unlike classical systems, however, identical quantum circuits may exhibit substantially different behavior across devices due to architectural variations in qubit connectivity, gate fidelity, and coherence times.\n  In this work, we systematically benchmark five representative quantum algorithms - Bell state preparation, GHZ state generation, Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), Grover's Search, and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) - across trapped-ion, superconducting, and simulator backends using Amazon Braket. Performance metrics including fidelity, CHSH violation, success probability, circuit depth, and gate counts are evaluated.\n  Our results demonstrate a strong dependence of algorithmic performance on hardware topology and noise characteristics. For example, 10-qubit GHZ states achieved fidelities above 0.8 on trapped-ion hardware, while superconducting platforms dropped below 0.15 due to routing overhead and accumulated two-qubit gate errors. These findings highlight the importance of hardware-aware algorithm selection and provide practical guidance for benchmarking in the NISQ era."}

Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography."}

Yet their practical usefulness and performance depend critically on reliability, quantified by the noise-to-signal ratios (NSRs), i.e., normalized fluctuations of work and power, where reliability decreases inversely with increasing NSR. We establish fundamental limits to this reliability: both work and power NSRs are universally bounded from below by a function of charging speed, imposing a reliability limit inherent to any quantum battery. More strikingly, we find that a quantum mechanical uncertainty relation forbids the simultaneous suppression of work and power fluctuations, revealing a fundamental trade-off that also limits the reliability of quantum batteries. We analyze the trade-off and limits, as well as their scaling behavior, across parallel (local), collective {(fully non-local)}, and hybrid (semi-local) charging schemes for many-body quantum batteries, finding that increasing power by exploiting stronger entanglement comes at the cost of diminished reliability of power. Similar trends are also observed in the charging of quantum batteries utilizing transverse Ising-like interactions. These suggest that achieving both high power and reliability require neither parallel nor collective charging, but a hybrid charging scheme with an intermediate range of interactions. Therefore, our analysis shapes the practical and efficient design of reliable and high-performance quantum batteries."}

In the present work, we study the breaking of Quantum Darwinism in a specific model and how that translates to non-classical measurement statistics.

A notable example is estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise using the repetition code, which is both optimal for metrology and robust against noise. However, previous protocols often assume noise affects only the signal accumulation step, while the QEC operations -- including state preparation and measurement -- are noiseless. To overcome this limitation, we study fault-tolerant quantum metrology where all qubit operations are subject to noise. We focus on estimating a Pauli-$Z$ signal under bit-flip noise, together with state preparation and measurement errors in all QEC operations. We propose a fault-tolerant metrological protocol where a repetition code is prepared via repeated syndrome measurements, followed by a fault-tolerant logical measurement. We demonstrate the existence of an error threshold, below which errors are effectively suppressed and the HL is attained."}

In this article, we investigate one particular realization of the 2nd Law, namely Joule heating in a wire under electrical bias. We analyze the production of entropy in an exactly solvable model of a quantum wire wherein the conserved flow of entropy under unitary quantum evolution is taken into account using an exact formula for the entropy current of a system of independent quantum particles. In this exact microscopic description of the quantum dynamics, the entropy production due to Joule heating does not arise automatically. Instead, we show that the expected entropy production is realized in the limit of a large number of local measurements by a series of floating thermoelectric probes along the length of the wire, which inject entropy into the system as a result of the information obtained via their continuous measurements of the system. The decoherence resulting from inelastic processes introduced by the local measurements is essential to the phenomenon of entropy production due to Joule heating, and would be expected to arise due to inelastic scattering in real systems of interacting particles."}

This enables the creation of a squeezed state of motion through the dynamic coupling between the ions' internal states and the phonon mode. Unlike traditional methods that require bath engineering, our model demonstrates that squeezed lasing can be achieved through a direct manipulation of ion-phonon interactions, with no external reservoirs required. We explore the steady-state behavior of the system, analyzing the onset of lasing, gain-loss balance, and the role of the squeezing parameter in shaping the phonon field's statistical properties. Furthermore, we show how external coherent drives can stabilize phase coherence and achieve controlled quadrature squeezing, offering a simple yet effective method for achieving squeezed lasing in quantum mechanical systems. Our findings provide new insights into the realization of squeezed states in phonon-based systems, with potential applications in quantum metrology and information processing."}

In the lossless scenario, we show that uniformly applied OPA significantly enhances the attainable precision beyond that of an unamplified interferometer. By analyzing the second-order correlation functions, we demonstrate that this enhancement originates from the amplification of intra-mode photon-number correlations, rather than from inter-mode correlations. We further extend our analysis to realistic interferometers with photon loss using a purification-based variational approach. Although loss degrades the achievable precision, the OPA-assisted scheme retains a clear advantage for moderate loss, indicating a degree of robustness against dissipation. Our results clarify the physical mechanism underlying OPA-enhanced multiparameter quantum metrology and provide guidelines for optimizing phase estimation protocols in realistic noisy environments."}

Our analysis of the classical phase-space structure and its excited-state quantum phase transitions leads us to three dynamical regimes: symmetry-breaking low-energy states, an intermediate region where quantum and classical equilibrium states markedly disagree, and a high-energy regime with restored correspondence. The observed classical intermittency above the first excited-state quantum phase transition contrasts with quantum dynamics, which remains trapped in symmetry-breaking sectors despite the existence of a classically connected phase space. This mismatch originates from the population of imbalance-carrying eigenstates and persists even for relatively large number of particles.

Its core input model is the block encoding framework, in which non-unitary matrices are embedded into larger unitary matrices. Because the gate complexity of the block-encoding subroutine largely determines the overall cost of QSVT-based algorithms, developing new and more efficient block encodings is crucial for achieving practical quantum advantage. In this paper, we introduce a novel method for constructing quantum circuits that block encode linear combinations of Pauli strings. Our approach relies on two key components. First, we apply a transformation that converts the Pauli strings into pairwise anti-commuting ones, making the transformed linear combination unitary and thus directly implementable as a quantum circuit. Second, we employ a correction transformation based on the stabilizer formalism which uses an ancilla register to restore the original Pauli strings. Our method can be implemented with an ancilla register whose size scales logarithmically with the number of system qubits. It can also be extended to larger ancilla registers, which can substantially reduce the overall quantum circuit complexity. We present four concrete examples and use numerical simulations to compare our method's circuit complexity with that of the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) approach. We find that our method achieves circuit complexities comparable to or better than LCU, with possible advantages when the structure of the target operators can be exploited. These results suggest that our approach could enable more efficient block encodings for a range of relevant problems extending beyond the examples analyzed in this work."}

When the interaction vanishes, QIBD reduces to the classical Bhattacharyya distance; however, for entangling interactions, it cannot be expressed as a function of fidelity alone. Numerical simulations demonstrate that QIBD responds to correlation structure in ways that overlap-based measures do not, suggesting potential utility in contexts where interaction-aligned correlations are physically relevant."}

Collisional interactions during storage then implement one-axis-twisting dynamics and generate spin squeezing in the atomic ensemble.

Therefore, any which-way information present in the photons will degrade quantum interference and introduce errors.

We experimentally demonstrate scalable, optimal photon distillation as a substantially more resource-efficient strategy to reduce indistinguishability errors in a way that is compatible with fault-tolerant operation. Photon distillation is an intrinsically bosonic, coherent error-mitigation technique which exploits quantum interference to project single photons into purified internal states, thereby reducing indistinguishability errors at both a higher efficiency and higher threshold than quantum error correction. We observe unconditional error reduction (i.e., below-threshold behaviour) consistent with theoretical predictions, even when accounting for noise introduced by the distillation gate, thereby achieving actual net-gain error mitigation under conditions relevant for fault-tolerant quantum computing. We anticipate photon distillation will find uses in large-scale quantum computers.

However, their vulnerability to noise limits the accuracy of simulations. Here, we establish a new framework for mitigating noise in analogue quantum simulation, operating in a time-continuous manner. To our knowledge, this is the first protocol that is fully analogue and that achieves exact noise cancellation. Our method requires a small number of ancillary qubits, whose interaction with the system$-$combined with classical post-processing of joint measurement data$-$is tailored to cancel the effect of noise. Furthermore, the protocol is Hamiltonian-independent, robust to realistic ancilla noise, and avoids any discretization, preserving the continuous-time nature of the system's dynamics. This work opens a new direction for achieving high-fidelity analogue quantum simulation in the presence of noise."}

On the other hand, counterdiabatic algorithms have shown advantages in both performance and circuit depth when compared to standard adiabatic approaches. In this work, we propose a hybrid method that integrates the ADAPT-VQE framework with counterdiabatic driving within an adiabatic evolution scheme. Specifically, we map the molecular Hamiltonian to a qubit representation and construct an adiabatic Hamiltonian, from which an approximate adiabatic gauge potential is computed using nested commutators. The resulting operator terms define the operator pool, and the ADAPT-VQE algorithm is applied to iteratively select the most relevant elements for the ansatz. Our results demonstrate improvements in performance and reductions in circuit depth compared to using either counterdiabatic algorithms or ADAPT-VQE with fermionic excitation operators, thus supporting the effectiveness of combining both paradigms in molecular simulations."}

By deriving a complete analytical solution for the two-emitter case and employing a numerically exact method for larger ensembles, we characterize the full transition from Markovian to non-Markovian collective dynamics for systems of up to $10^3$ emitters. Our results reveal three distinct regimes: a Markovian phase exhibiting the standard superradiant burst, a non-Markovian phase featuring spontaneous superabsorption of the emitted field, and a critical regime marked by pulsed collective emission. We show that the critical spectral width separating these behaviors increases monotonically with the number of emitters, demonstrating that environmental memory effects can be enhanced by cooperativity. Finally, we find that the superradiant scaling of the peak intensity progressively degrades with increasing system size, approaching a subquadratic law in the limit of a perfect cavity. In this regime, spontaneous superabsorption emerges as a distinct manifestation of non-Markovian cooperativity."}
