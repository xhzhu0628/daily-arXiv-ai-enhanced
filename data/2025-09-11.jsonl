Through symmetry-based circuit synthesis\nand optimized error correction, we reduce the required logical and physical\nresources by two orders of magnitude. Our concrete resource analysis\ndemonstrates that solving NSE on a $2^{80}$-grid is feasible with 8.71 million\nphysical qubits (at an error rate of $5 \\times 10^{-4}$) in 42.6 days --\noutperforming a state-of-the-art supercomputer, which would require over a\ncentury. This work bridges the gap between theoretical quantum speedup and the\npractical deployment of high-performance scientific computing."}

We\ndevelop a Quantum Cardinality Estimation (QCardEst) approach using Quantum\nMachine Learning with a Hybrid Quantum-Classical Network. We define a compact\nencoding for turning SQL queries into a quantum state, which requires only\nqubits equal to the number of tables in the query. This allows the processing\nof a complete query with a single variational quantum circuit (VQC) on current\nhardware. In addition, we compare multiple classical post-processing layers to\nturn the probability vector output of VQC into a cardinality value. We\nintroduce Quantum Cardinality Correction QCardCorr, which improves classical\ncardinality estimators by multiplying the output with a factor generated by a\nVQC to improve the cardinality estimation. With QCardCorr, we have an\nimprovement over the standard PostgreSQL optimizer of 6.37 times for JOB-light\nand 8.66 times for STATS. For JOB-light we even outperform MSCN by a factor of\n3.47."}
