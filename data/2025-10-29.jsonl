However, their working principle, based on Coriolis effects,\nhas become increasingly ineffective for addressing modern sensing challenges in\ncomplex scenarios. Fortunately, recent advancements in quantized SAWs offer a\npromising solution: SAWs operating at extremely low pump powers (approximately\nat the single-phonon level) can exhibit substantial quantum coherence, enabling\ninvestigations into the fundamental limits of SAW gyroscopes as constrained by\nthe Heisenberg uncertainty relation. In particular, when multiple SAWs couple\nto a common waveguide at distinct locations, the nonlocality arising from the\nspatial separation among coupling points induces directional coupling between\nthe SAWs.

Unlike traditional single-point\ncoupling designs, our gyroscope exhibits distinctive time-delayed dynamics that\ndepend on the system's topologies. We emphasize that these dynamics invalidate\nthe Markovian approximation, even when the time delay is relatively small.\nThrough a comprehensive analysis of all possible topologies, we observe that\nthe directional coupling implies an inherent nonreciprocal transfer.

We develop MPS-based classical algorithms for\nlossy boson sampling and noisy instantaneous quantum polynomial-time (IQP)\nsampling, both of which retain the tunable accuracy characteristic of the MPS\napproach through the bond dimension. Our approach constructs pure-state\ndecompositions of noisy or lossy input states whose components remain weakly\nentangled after circuit evolution, thereby providing a means to systematically\nexplore the boundary between quantum-hard and classically-simulable regimes.\nFor boson sampling, we analyze single-photon, Fock, and cat-state inputs,\nshowing that classical simulability emerges at transmission rates scaling as\n$O(1/\\sqrt{N})$, reaching the known boundary of quantum advantage with a\ntunable and scalable method.
