And the other way around: any model is subquantum in appropriate\narithmetic and calculus. Probabilities involving more than two events are\nconstructed by means of trees of binary conditional probabilities. We discuss\nfrom this perspective singlet-state probabilities and Bell inequalities. We\nfind that singlet state probabilities involve simultaneously three levels of\nthe hierarchy: quantum, hidden, and macroscopic.

By comparing these two\ncomplementary approaches, we show how canonical paradoxes--including\nSchr\\\"odinger's cat and Wigner's friend--dissolve once context is made\nexplicit. The result is a flexible logical framework that reconciles\nWittgensteinian conceptual therapy, Bohr's complementarity, and the Jaina\npluralistic tradition, offering a coherent semantics for quantum discourse."}

For institutions that\nissue and manage extensive loan volumes, even a slight improvement in default\nprediction precision can significantly enhance financial stability and\nregulatory adherence, resulting in better customer experience and satisfaction.\nDatasets associated with credit default prediction often exhibit temporal\ncorrelations and high dimensionality. These attributes can lead to accuracy\ndegradation and performance issues when scaling classical predictive algorithms\ntailored for these datasets. Given these limitations, quantum algorithms,\nleveraging their innate ability to handle high-dimensionality problems, emerge\nas a promising new avenue alongside classical approaches. To assess the\nviability and effectiveness of quantum methodologies, we investigate a hybrid\nquantum-classical algorithm, utilizing a publicly available \"Default Prediction\nDataset\" released as part of a third-party data science competition.\nSpecifically, we employ hybrid quantum-classical machine learning models based\non projected quantum feature maps and their ensemble integration with classical\nmodels to examine the problem of credit card default prediction. Our results\nindicate that the ensemble models based on the projected quantum features were\ncapable of slightly improving the purely classical results expressed via a\n\"Composite Default Risk\" (CDR) metric. Furthermore, we discuss the practical\napplicability of the studied quantum-classical machine learning techniques and\naddress open questions concerning their implementation."}

Our construction features\ncompilation problems with loss landscapes for discrete optimization that are\nunimodal yet non-separable, a structure known in classical optimization to\nconfer exponential advantages to adaptive search.
