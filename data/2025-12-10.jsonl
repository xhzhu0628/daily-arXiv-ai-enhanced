We posit that fundamental quantum mechanical operations, superposition, entanglement, interference, and measurement, naturally map to essential reasoning primitives such as hypothesis branching, constraint propagation, consistency enforcement, and decision making. The resulting framework combines quantum-inspired computation with differentiable optimization, enabling reasoning to emerge as a process of amplitude evolution and interference-driven selection of self-consistent states. We develop the mathematical foundation of QCRM, define its parameterized circuit architecture, and show how logical rules can be encoded as unitary transformations over proposition-qubit states. We further formalize a training objective grounded in classical gradient descent over circuit parameters and discuss simulation-based implementations on classical hardware. Finally, we propose the Quantum Reasoning Layer (QRL) as a differentiable hybrid component for composable reasoning models applicable to scientific, biomedical, and chemical inference domains."}

We investigate an external-field-driven qubit QB coupled to a harmonic oscillator catalyst, revealing a key thermodynamic mechanism: the catalyst induces transient negative heat flow ($J(t)<0$, or energy backflow) into the battery. This backflow actively counters dephasing losses, rapidly pushing the qubit into non-passive states, and results in a drastic enhancement of extractable work (Ergotropy). Leveraging the quantum first law, we precisely quantify this causal link between negative heat flux and QB performance enhancement. Our work uncovers the fundamental role of transient thermodynamic backflow in quantum catalysis, offering a crucial blueprint for high-performance quantum energy storage devices."}

By incorporating a broader representation-theoretic perspective, we provide a generalized framework that allows the code designer to take this structure into account. For any representation of a finite group, we produce a quantum code with a code space invariant under the group action, providing passive error mitigation against errors belonging to the image of the representation. Furthermore, errors outside this scope are detected and diagnosed by performing a projective measurement onto the isotypic components corresponding to irreducible representations of the chosen group, effectively generalizing syndrome extraction to symmetry-resolved quantum measurements. We show that all stabilizer codes are a special case of this construction, including qudit stabilizer codes, and show that there is a natural one logical qubit code associated to the dihedral group. Thus we provide a unifying framework for existing codes while simultaneously facilitating symmetry-aware codes tailored to specific systems."}

We present a quantum framework to address these issues. We employ a probability density function (PDF) formulation to transform the nonlinear reacting-flow governing equations into high-dimensional linear ones. The entire temporal evolution is then solved as a single large linear system using the history state method, which avoids the measurement bottleneck of conventional time-marching schemes and fully leverages the advantages of quantum linear system algorithms. To extract the quantity of interest from the resulting quantum state, we develop an efficient algorithm to measure the statistical moments of the PDF, bypassing the need for costly full-state tomography. A computational complexity analysis indicates the potential for a near-exponential speedup over classical algorithms. We validate the framework by simulating a perfectly stirred reactor, demonstrating its capability to capture the PDF evolution and statistics of a nonlinear reactive system.

These viscosity solutions play a central role in areas such as front propagation, mean-field games, optimal control, machine learning, and a direct application to the forced Burgers' equation. Our method is based on an entropy penalisation method proposed by Gomes and Valdinoci, which generalises the Cole-Hopf transform from quadratic to general convex Hamiltonians, allowing a reformulation of viscous Hamilton-Jacobi dynamics by a discrete-time linear dynamics which approximates a linear heat-like parabolic equation, and can also extend to continuous-time dynamics. This makes the method suitable for quantum simulation. The validity of these results hold for arbitrary nonlinearity that correspond to convex Hamiltonians, and for arbitrarily long times, thus obviating a chief obstacle in most quantum algorithms for nonlinear partial differential equations. We provide quantum algorithms, both analog and digital, for extracting pointwise values, gradients, minima, and function evaluations at the minimiser of the viscosity solution, without requiring nonlinear updates or full state reconstruction."}

While this phenomenon has so far been studied in two-photon systems, exchange symmetries and interference effects in multi-photon scenarios remain largely unexplored. In this work, we show that multi-photon states uncover a rich landscape of exchange symmetries. With three photons already, multiple pairwise combinations are possible, where each pair of photons can exhibit either bosonic, fermionic, or anyonic exchange symmetry. This gives rise to mixed symmetry systems that are not possible to achieve with two photon alone. We experimentally investigate how these symmetry configurations manifest themselves in the observed interference of three photons. We show that multi-photon interference can be effectively turned on and off by tuning the symmetry of the constituent pairs. The possibility of accessing and tuning new quantum statistics in a scalable photonic platform not only deepens our understanding of quantum systems, but is also highly relevant for quantum technologies that rely on quantum interference."}

Single-qubit control and readout have been demonstrated recently using SFQ circuits coupled to superconducting qubits. Experiments where the SFQ electronics are co-located with the qubit have suffered from excess decoherence and loss due to quasiparticle poisoning of the qubit. A previous experiment by our group showed that moving the control electronics to the 3 K stage of the dilution refrigerator avoided this source of decoherence in a high-coherence 3D transmon geometry. In this paper, we also generate the pulses at the 3 K stage but have optimized the qubit design and control lines for scalable 2D transmon devices. We directly compare the qubit lifetime $T_1$, coherence time $T_2^*$ and gate fidelity when the qubit is controlled by the Josephson pulse generator (JPG) circuit versus the TSCE setup. We find agreement to within the daily fluctuations for $T_1$ and $T_2^*$, and agreement to within 10% for randomized benchmarking. We also performed interleaved randomized benchmarking on individual JPG gates demonstrating an average error per gate of $0.46$% showing good agreement with what is expected based on the qubit coherence and higher-state leakage. These results are an order of magnitude improvement in gate fidelity over our previous work and demonstrate that a Josephson microwave source operated at 3 K is a promising component for scalable qubit control."}

When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics."}

We derive closed-form analytical expressions for the actions, which allow us to determine the two conditions to get periodic closed trajectories. We classify these trajectories through the indices $(s,t,\\ell)$. The caustic paraboloids that bound the motion provide a complete geometric characterization of admissible trajectories. Quantum mechanically, separability of the Schrödinger equation in parabolic coordinates yields eigenmodes described by Whittaker functions. We determine the energy spectrum and identify degeneracies arising not only from azimuthal symmetry but also from specific cavity deformations. A direct correspondence between classical trajectories and quantum eigenstates reveals that probability densities concentrate in the classically allowed region with controlled penetration into forbidden zones."}

Groups of cold atomic ions in an externally applied trapping potential self-organize into \"Coulomb crystals\" due to their mutual electrostatic repulsion.

While this enables studies of many-body physics, it limits the flexibility and tunability of the system as a quantum platform. Here, we demonstrate an array of trapped ions in individual trapping sites whose motional modes can be controllably coupled and decoupled by tuning the local applied confining potential for each ion. We show that a single motional quantum, or phonon, can be coherently shared among two or three ions confined at the vertices of an equilateral triangle 30 $μ$m on a side. We can adiabatically tune the ion participation in the motional modes around a closed contour in configuration space, observing that the single-phonon wavefunction acquires a topological Berry phase if the contour encircles a conical intersection of motional eigenvalue surfaces. We observe this phase by single-phonon interference and study its breakdown as the motional mode tuning becomes non-adiabiatic. Our results show that precise, individual quantum control of ion motion in a two-dimensional array can provide unique access to quantum multi-body effects."}

While the mathematical theory underpinning quantum correlations between spacelike separated systems has been well-established since the 1930s, the mathematical theory for correlations between non-spacelike separated systems is much less developed. In this work, we develop the theory of what we refer to as \"local-density operators\", which we view as joint states for possibly non-spacelike separated quantum systems. Local-density operators are unit trace operators whose marginals are genuine density operators, which we show not only subsumes the notion of density operator, but also several extensions of the notion of density operator into the spatiotemporal domain, such as pseudo-density operators and quantum states over time. More importantly, we prove a result which establishes a one-to-one correspondence between local-density operators and what we refer to as \"Dirac measures\", which are complex-valued measures on the space of separable projectors associated with two quantum systems. In the case that one of the systems is the trivial quantum system with a one-dimensional Hilbert space, our result recovers the fundamental result known as Gleason's Theorem, which implies that the Born rule from quantum theory is the only way in which one may assign probabilities to the outcomes of measurements performed on quantum systems in a non-contextual manner. As such, our results establish a direct generalization of Gleason's Theorem to measurements performed on possibly non-spacelike separated systems, thus extending the mathematical theory of quantum correlations across space to quantum correlations across space and time."}

As the number of qubits increases, the probability density sharply concentrates around the maximally mixed state, making nearly pure coarse-grained states increasingly unlikely.

In these protocols, pre-shared entanglement enables either the faithful transfer of quantum states or the transmission of more information than is possible classically. However, channel losses degrade the shared states, reducing teleportation fidelity and the information advantage in superdense coding. Here, we investigate how to mitigate these effects by optimising the measurements applied by the communicating parties. We formulate the problem as an optimisation over general positive operator-valued measurements (POVMs) and compare the results with physically realisable noiseless attenuation (NA) and noiseless linear amplification (NLA) circuits. For teleportation, NLA/NA and optimised POVMs improve the average fidelity by up to 78% while maintaining feasible success probabilities. For superdense coding, they enhance the quantum advantage over the classical channel capacity by more than 100% in some regimes and shift the break-even point, thereby extending the tolerable range of losses.

Within this framework, we identify quantum programmable classes enabled by symmetry and stochastic structure, including covariant semigroups and fully dissipative Pauli Lindbladians with finite program dimension. We further provide a necessary condition for physical programmability that rules out coherent generators and typical dissipators generating amplitude damping. For such nonphysically programmable cases, we construct explicit protocols with finite resources. Finally, we introduce an operational programming cost, defined via the number of samples required to program the Lindbladian, and establish its core structural properties, such as continuity and faithfulness. These results provide a notion of programming cost for Lindbladians, bridge programmable channel theory and open system dynamics, and yield symmetry driven compression schemes and actionable resource estimates for semigroup simulation and control in noisy quantum technologies."}

A central challenge today is to understand the behavior of complex quantum many-body systems, where interactions play an essential role. About four decades ago, Richard Feynman proposed using controllable quantum systems to efficiently simulate complex physics and chemistry problems, envisioning quantum orreries, highly tunable quantum devices built to emulate less understood quantum systems. Here we ask whether quantum simulators have already uncovered new physical phenomena-and, if so, in which areas and with what impact. We find that, in several notable instances, they have advanced our understanding of many-body quantum dynamics. Although many of these insights could in principle have been obtained theoretically or numerically, they were nevertheless first achieved using quantum processors. While a broad landscape of problems beyond non-equilibrium dynamics still awaits exploration, it is encouraging that quantum simulators are already beginning to challenge and refine our conventional wisdom."}

In this paper, we employed mean field approximation theory to study the semiclassical dynamics in the Rabi-Stark model (RSM) and showed that the nonlinear Stark coupling significantly modulates the semiclassical phase space structure. By analyzing the linear entanglement entropy of coherent states prepared in the classical chaotic and regular regions of the semiclassical phase space, we demonstrate that quantum-classical correspondence can be achieved in the RSM with large atom-light frequency ratios. While this correspondence fails in the resonant Rabi model because its truncated photon number is insufficient to approach the large quantum number limit, we discovered that in the resonant RSM when the nonlinear Stark coupling $U \\to \\pm 1$, the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy correlates strongly with the semiclassical phase space. In particular, when $U \\to -1$, the truncated photon number in the resonant RSM is very close to that in the resonant Rabi model, but the time-averaged linear entanglement entropy still corresponds well with the semiclassical phase space. This result demonstrates that quantum-classical correspondence can be realized in the few-body resonant RSM."}

For such communication, itinerant microwave photons propagating through transmission lines offer a promising approach. However, demonstrations to date have relied on frequency-tunable circuit elements to compensate for fabrication-related parameter variations between sender and receiver devices, introducing control complexity and limiting scalability. In this work, we demonstrate deterministic quantum state transfer and remote entanglement generation between fixed-frequency superconducting qubits on separate chips. To compensate for the sender-receiver mismatch, we employ a frequency-tunable photon-generation technique which enables us to adjust the photon frequency without modifying circuit parameters. To enhance the frequency tunability, we implement broadband transfer resonators composed of two coupled coplanar-waveguide resonators, achieving a bandwidth of more than 100 MHz. This broadband design enables successful quantum communication across a 30-MHz range of photon frequencies between the remote qubits. Quantum process tomography reveals state transfer fidelities of around 78% and Bell-state fidelities of around 73% across the full frequency range. Our approach avoids the complexity of the control lines and noise channels, providing a flexible pathway toward scalable quantum networks."}

In this paper, we reformulate the unstructured search as a maximization problem on the unitary manifold and solve it via the Riemannian gradient ascent (RGA) method. To overcome the difficulty that generic RGA updates do not, in general, correspond to physically implementable quantum operators, we introduce Grover-compatible retractions to restrict RGA updates to valid oracle and diffusion operators. Theoretically, we establish a local Riemannian $μ$-Polyak-Łojasiewicz (PL) inequality with $μ= \\tfrac{1}{2}$, which yields a linear convergence rate of $1 - κ^{-1}$ toward the global solution. Here, the condition number $κ= L_{\\mathrm{Rie}} / μ$, where $L_{\\mathrm{Rie}}$ denotes the Riemannian Lipschitz constant of the gradient.

Its non-Gaussian resources, essential for outperforming any classical system, are provided by single-photon inputs and click detection. Yet the drive toward larger experiments has led to the replacement of experimentally demanding single-photon sources with Gaussian states, thereby diminishing the available non-Gaussianity-a critical quantum resource. As the community broadens its focus from the initial sampling task to possible real-world applications, it becomes crucial to quantify the performance cost associated with reducing non-Gaussian resources and to benchmark sampling platforms that employ different input states.\n  To address this need, we introduce the Paderborn Quantum Sampler (PaQS), a hybrid platform capable of performing sampling experiments with eight Gaussian or non-Gaussian input states in a 12-mode interferometer within a single experimental run. This architecture enables direct, side-by-side benchmarking of distinct sampling regimes under otherwise identical conditions. By employing a semi-device-independent framework, offering certification that does not rely on prior knowledge of the interferometer or the input states, we verify that the observed data cannot be reproduced by any classical model-a prerequisite for demonstrating quantum advantage.

Yet their generation remains fundamentally constrained: in the absence of intrinsic photon-photon interactions, the generation of such states is inherently probabilistic rather than deterministic. The prevalent technique of post-selection verifies the creation of an entangled state by detecting and thus destroying it. Heralding offers a solution in which measuring ancillary photons in auxiliary modes signals the state generation without the need to measure it. Here, we report an experiment to generate a three-mode two-photon NOON state, where the detection of a single photon in one heralding mode signifies the presence of the state in three target modes. We validate the generated state by estimating a fidelity of 0.823 +/- 0.018 with respect to an ideal three-mode NOON state and certifying genuine multipartite entanglement. By virtue of the high success probability and small resource overhead of our scheme, our work provides a theoretical and experimental stepping stone for entangled multi-mode state generation, which is realizable with current technology.

We offer a structural explanation from minimal constraints on finite descriptions of admissible histories. Assume that histories admit finite, self-delimiting (prefix-free) generative codes that can be decoded sequentially in a single forward pass. These purely syntactic requirements define a minimal descriptive cost, interpretable as a smoothed minimal program length, that is additive over local segments. First, any continuous local additive cost whose stationary sector coincides with the empirically identified classical variational sector is forced into a unique Euler--Lagrange equivalence class. Hence the universal form of an action is fixed by descriptional structure alone, while the specific microscopic Lagrangian and couplings remain system-dependent semantic input. Second, independently of microscopic stochasticity, finite prefix-free languages exhibit exponential redundancy: many distinct programs encode the same coarse history, and this redundancy induces a universal exponential multiplicity weight on histories. Requiring this weight to be real and bounded below selects a real Euclidean representative for stable local bosonic systems, yielding the standard Euclidean path-integral form. When Osterwalder--Schrader reflection positivity holds, the Euclidean measure reconstructs a unitary Lorentzian amplitude."}

By intentionally unbalancing the input beamsplitter that splits the quantum signal, we show that the detection scheme itself performs an effective squeezing or anti-squeezing transformation on the state being measured.

The setup consists of a microwave cavity mode coupled to magnons in a single-crystal yttrium iron garnet sphere, which in turn are hybridized with a vibrational mechanical mode through magnetostrictive interaction. In the Hermitian regime, strong photon-magnon coupling generates a single transparency window in the cavity transmission, which splits into a doublet when the magnon is coherently hybridized with the mechanical mode via magnomechanical coupling. This establishes a versatile platform in which the transparency spectrum can be engineered from single- to multi-window response using experimentally accessible, scaled magnomechanical interactions. When a non-Hermitian coupling is introduced, the system enters a parity-time-broken regime in which the transparency ceases to be purely passive and becomes gain assisted, leading to asymmetric transmission with amplification on one side of the resonance and enhanced absorption on the other. By tuning the cavity detuning, we convert magnomechanical transparency into Fano-type line shapes with strongly non-Lorentzian phase dispersion and map their deformation into asymmetric, gain-assisted Fano ridges in the joint space of probe and magnon detunings. Finally, we analyze the associated group delay and show that both slow- and fast-light behavior can be widely tuned by varying the photon-magnon and magnomechanical couplings together with the non-Hermitian strength, highlighting parity-time-symmetric cavity magnomechanics as a promising platform for reconfigurable quantum signal processing and enhanced sensing."}

While deterministic generation of CV states via Kerr-induced two-mode squeezing has been demonstrated, achieving spectrally uniform squeezing remains challenging because of asymmetry and anomalies in the dispersion profile. Here we overcome these limitations by combining a microresonator with an engineered mode spectrum and optimized pump conditions. We realize a CV quantum microcomb comprising 14 independent two-mode squeezed states, each exhibiting more than 4 dB of raw squeezing (up to 4.3 dB) across a 0.7 THz bandwidth. This uniform, high-performance quantum resource represents a key step toward scalable, integrated CV quantum technologies operating beyond classical limits."}

In this work, we present a framework for spectroscopic readout of chiral photonic topology in a single driven optical cavity containing a spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensate. We demonstrate that the cavity transmission power spectral density provides a direct and measurable proxy for a momentum- and frequency-resolved photonic Chern marker, enabling topological characteristics to be inferred from spectral data without the need for bulk-band tomography. In the loss-dominated regime, where cavity decay exceeds atomic dissipation, the power spectral density exhibits Dirac-like gapped hybrid modes with a vanishing Chern marker, indicating a trivial phase. When the dissipation imbalance is reversed, a bright, gap-spanning spectral ridge emerges, co-localized with peaks in both the Chern marker and Berry curvature. The complex spectrum reveals parity-time symmetric coalescences and gain-loss bifurcations, marking exceptional points and enabling chiral, gap-traversing transport. By linking noise spectroscopy to geometric and non-Hermitian topology in a minimal cavity-QED architecture, this work provides a framework for spectroscopic detection of topological order in driven quantum systems. This approach offers a pathway to compact, tunable topological photonics across a broad range of light-matter platforms, providing a method for the study and control of topological phases in hybrid quantum systems."}

This class encompasses not only standard uniformly controlled gates (UCGs) but also a wide range of circuits with uniformly controlled structures. However, their circuit-depth and gate-count complexities have not been systematically analyzed within a unified framework. In this work, we study the general decomposition problem for UCG and UCG-like structure. We then introduce the restricted Uniformly Controlled Gates (rUCGs) as a unified algebraic model, defined by a 2-divisible Abelian group that models the controlled gate set. This model captures uniformly controlled rotations, multi-qubit uniformly controlled gates, and diagonal unitaries. Furthermore, this model also naturally incorporates k-sparse version (k-rUCGs), where only a subset of control qubits participate in each multi-qubit gate. Building on this algebraic model, we develop a general framework. For an n-control rUCG, the framework reduce the gate complexity from ${O(n2^n)}$ to ${O(2^n})$ and the circuit depth from ${O(2^n\\log n)}$ to ${O(2^n\\log n/n)}$. The framework further provides systematic size and depth bounds for k-rUCGs by exploiting sparsity in the control space, with same optimization coefficient as rUCG, respectively. Empirical evaluations on representative QAOA circuits and quantum state preparation both confirm reductions in depth and size. Crucially, these results highlight that the rUCG model and its associated decomposition framework unify circuits previously considered structurally distinct under a single, asymptotically optimal synthesis paradigm."}

Recently, this framework is extended to characterize quantum phase transitions in arXiv:2509.20258 by introducing the concepts of non-Hermitian symmetry breaking and fidelity zeros. Here, we generalize the theory by studying a broad class of quantum models, including the XY model, the XXZ model, the XYZ model, and the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model in one dimension, subject to complex external magnetic field. For the XY, XXZ and XYZ models, we find that the complex field breaks parity symmetry and induces oscillations of the ground state between the two parity sectors, giving rise to fidelity zeros within the ordered phases. For the $\\mathbb{Z}_3$ clock model, the complex field splits the real part of the ground-state energy between the neutral sector ($q=0$) and the charged sectors ($q=1,2$), while preserving the degeneracy within the charged sector. Fidelity zeros arise only after projecting out one of the charged sectors, and the finite-size scaling of these zeros produces critical exponents fully consistent with analytical predictions."}

We further discuss how this framework connects naturally to realizations in tweezer arrays with Rydberg excitations. In certain cases, the effective geometry can be incorporated in the layout of atoms in tweezers to realize phase transitions that preserve universal features, simplifying their implementation in near-term experiments."}

To understand this emergent non-Markovianity, we define a Markovianity condition appropriate to logical gate operations, and study it by relating logical operations to their physical implementation (operations on the data qubits into which the logical qubit is encoded). We apply our analysis to small quantum codes, and show that they exhibit non-Markovian dynamics even for very simple physical noise models. We show that non-Markovianity can emerge from Markovian physical operations if (and only if) the physical qubits are not necessarily returned to the code subspace after every round of QEC. In this situation, the syndrome qubits can act as a memory, mediating time correlations and enabling violation of the Markov condition. We quantify the emergent non-Markovianity in simple examples, and propose sufficient conditions for reliable use of gate-based characterization techniques like gate set tomography in early fault-tolerant quantum devices."}

Comments welcome!", "summary": "It is a well-known fact in classical information theory that no deterministic procedure can extract close-to-ideal randomness from an arbitrary entropy source. On the other hand, if additional knowledge about the source is available -- e.g., that it is a sequence of independent Bernoulli trials -- then deterministic extractors do exist. For quantum entropy sources, where in addition to classical random variables we consider quantum side information, the use of extra knowledge about their structure was pioneered in a recent publication [C. Foreman and L. Masanes, Quantum 9, 1654 (2025)]. In that work, the authors provide deterministic extractors for device-independent randomness generation with memoryless devices achieving a sufficiently high CHSH score. In this work, we extend their construction to the prepare-and-measure scenario. Specifically, we prove that the considered functions are also extractors for memoryless devices in a semi-device-independent setting under an overlap assumption on the prepared quantum states. We then simulate the resulting randomness generation protocol on a novel and experimentally relevant family of behaviors, observing positive key rates already for $7\\times 10^3$ rounds."}

Classical methods like Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) exhibit variable performance across noise models and suffer from polynomial complexity, while tensor network decoders achieve high accuracy but at prohibitively high computational cost. Recent neural decoders reduce complexity but lack the accuracy needed to compete with computationally expensive classical methods. We introduce SAQ-Decoder, a unified framework combining transformer-based learning with constraint aware post-processing that achieves both near Maximum Likelihood (ML) accuracy and linear computational scalability with respect to the syndrome size. Our approach combines a dual-stream transformer architecture that processes syndromes and logical information with asymmetric attention patterns, and a novel differentiable logical loss that directly optimizes Logical Error Rates (LER) through smooth approximations over finite fields. SAQ-Decoder achieves near-optimal performance, with error thresholds of 10.99% (independent noise) and 18.6% (depolarizing noise) on toric codes that approach the ML bounds of 11.0% and 18.9% while outperforming existing neural and classical baselines in accuracy, complexity, and parameter efficiency. Our findings establish that learned decoders can simultaneously achieve competitive decoding accuracy and computational efficiency, addressing key requirements for practical fault-tolerant quantum computing systems."}
