However, when optimized using gradient descent, VQAs often suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, commonly known as the barren plateau. Various methods have been proposed to mitigate this issue. In this work, we propose a hybrid approach that integrates a classical proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller with a neural network to update the parameters of variational quantum circuits. We refer to this method as NPID, which aims to mitigate the barren plateau. The proposed algorithm is tested on randomly generated quantum input states and random quantum circuits with parametric noise to evaluate its universality, and additional simulations are conducted under different noise rates to examine its robustness. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated based on its convergence speed toward the target cost value. Simulation results show that NPID achieves a convergence efficiency 2-9 times higher than NEQP and QV, with performance fluctuations averaging only 4.45% across different noise levels. These results highlight the potential of integrating classical control theory into quantum optimization, providing a new perspective for improving the trainability and stability of variational quantum algorithms."}

A key question is how problem structure itself influences algorithmic resilience. In this work, we present a comprehensive, hardware-aware benchmarking study of the Bernstein-Vazirani algorithm across 11 diverse test patterns on multiple superconducting quantum processors, revealing that algorithmic performance is exquisitely sensitive to problem structure. Our results reveal average success rates of 100.0\\% (ideal simulation), 85.2\\% (noisy emulation), and 26.4\\% (real hardware), representing a dramatic 58.8\\% average performance gap between noisy emulation and real hardware execution. With quantum state tomography confirming corresponding average state fidelities of 0.993, 0.760, and a 0.234 fidelity drop to hardware. Performance degrades dramatically from 75.7\\% success for sparse patterns to complete failure for high-density 10-qubit patterns. Most strikingly, quantum state tomography reveals a near-perfect correlation between pattern density and state fidelity degradation, providing the fundamental explanation for observed performance patterns. The catastrophic fidelity collapse observed in real hardware measurements -- dropping to 0.111 compared to the predicted 0.763 -- underscores severe limitations in current noise models for capturing structure-dependent error mechanisms.

We show that within the special class of such functional theories where the space of external potentials forms the Lie algebra of a compact Lie group, the $N$-representability problem is readily solved by applying techniques from the study of momentum maps in symplectic geometry, an approach complementary to Klyachko's famous solution to the quantum marginal problem. The ``boundary force'', a diverging repulsive force from the boundary of the functional's domain observed in previous works but only qualitatively understood in isolated systems, is studied quantitatively and extensively in our work. Specifically, we present a formula capturing the exact behavior of the functional close to the boundary. In the case where the Lie algebra is abelian, a completely rigorous proof of the boundary force formula based on Levy-Lieb constrained search is given. Our formula is a first step towards developing more accurate functional approximations, with the potential of improving current RDMFT approximate functionals such as the Piris natural orbital functionals (NOFs).

We demonstrate that exponentially accelerated thermalisation in open system dynamics modelled by a Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation is highly sensitive to noise induced deviations in the initial state, making this approach to accelerated thermalisation difficult to achieve. In contrast, we demonstrate that accelerated restoration of symmetry in $U(1)$ symmetric random unitary circuits via increased initial symmetry breaking is robust in the presence of state preparation error. When large errors are present in the state preparation, we show that this can in fact induce a higher rate of symmetry restoration and a stronger QME."}

We focus on states with $F_Q \\sim N^{1+γ}$ where $γ\\in (0,1]$, i.e., scaling from the standard quantum limit to the Heisenberg limit. For short-range interactions ($α> 2d+1$), we prove the minimum time $t$ scales as $t \\gtrsim L^γ$, where $L \\sim N^{1/d}$.

Implementing spin-adapted transformations on quantum hardware, however, is challenging because the corresponding fermionic generators translate into noncommuting Pauli operators. In this work, we introduce an exact and computationally efficient factorization of spin-adapted unitaries derived from fermionic double excitation and deexcitation rotations. These unitaries are expressed as ordered products of exponentials of Pauli operators. Our method exploits the fact that the elementary operators in these generators form small Lie algebras. By working in the adjoint representation of these algebras, we reformulate the factorization problem as a low-dimensional nonlinear optimization over matrix exponentials. This approach enables precise numerical reparametrization of the unitaries without relying on symbolic manipulations. The proposed factorization provides a practical strategy for constructing symmetry-conserving quantum circuits within variational algorithms. It preserves spin symmetry by design, reduces implementation cost, and ensures the accurate representation of electronic states in quantum simulations of molecular systems."}

In this work we propose a globalized CQM in the QRM by introducing an auxiliary nonlinear term which is realizable and can extend the critical point to a continuous critical regime. As a consequence, a high measurement precision is globally available over the entire coupling regime from the original critical point of the QRM down to the weak-coupling limit, as demonstrated by the globally accessible diverging quantum Fisher information in dynamics. We illustrate a measurement scheme by quadrature dynamics, with globally criticality-enhanced inverted variance as well as the scaling relation with respect to finite frequencies. In particular, we find that the globally high measurement precisions still survive in the presence of decoherence. Our proposal paves a way to break the local limitation of QPT of the QRM in CQM and enables a broader application, with implications of applicability in realistic situation."}

Here, we investigate the application of an interacting Rydberg vapour for the purpose of time series prediction. The vapour is driven by a laser field whose Rabi frequency is modulated in order to input the time series. We find that close to a non-equilibrium phase transition, where collective effects are amplified, the capability of the system to learn the input becomes enhanced.

The variational parameters in our ansatz are derived from a global action principle, where Euler-Lagrange equations govern their optimal dynamics. Unlike conventional wavefunction-based variational methods, our approach specifically targets the time evolution operation and this allows a single set of optimized parameters to be applied to any initial state for a fixed Hamiltonian avoiding costly optimization procedures. Our method outperforms the standard Trotter-Suzuki formulas, typically achieving higher accuracy than higher-order Suzuki schemes. This translates directly to quantum computing applications, where it enables the design of quantum circuits with fewer gates which reduces noise and improves precision. Although we focus on quantum dynamics, the method is broadly applicable to problems involving general time-evolution operators. Applied to various model Hamiltonians, our approach reduces errors by factors of 2 to 5 compared to Trotter-Suzuki decompositions, demonstrating its promise for accurate quantum simulation with improved efficiency. In certain cases, the variational ansatz achieves higher accuracy than more complex higher-order Suzuki formulas while reducing the gate count by nearly half within a single circuit layer. Furthermore, we derive approximate analytical expressions for the variational parameters up to cubic order in time, valid for generic Hamiltonians. These approximations enable long-time quantum simulations with improved accuracy over equivalent Suzuki decompositions, providing ready-to-use evolution formulas that match Suzuki's gate complexity while delivering better performance."}

However, it is necessarily difficult to directly assess the performance of such high-quality logical qubits using standard Monte Carlo sampling because logical failure events become very rare.

Existing solutions are insufficient: post-quantum classical protocols rely on computational assumptions that may not hold for decades, while purely quantum protocols are too resource-intensive for the sheer scale of IoT. This paper introduces the Quantum Anonymous Data Reporting (QADR) protocol, a hybrid framework that provides a theoretical benchmark and high-performance architecture for this challenge, designed for future fully-connected quantum networks. The protocol achieves scalable, quantum-resistant anonymity through a hybrid security model; it leverages information-theoretically secure keys from Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) to seed a quantum-secure pseudorandom function (QS-PRF), grounding its long-term data protection in well-established computational hardness assumptions. We also propose and analyze an automated slot reservation mechanism by making a deliberate trade-off: achieving high performance by accepting a quantifiable information leak during the anonymous slot reservation phase while maintaining strong unlinkability for the final data submission. Our security analysis formally quantifies the anonymity reduction caused by the leak and discusses pathways to fully mitigate it at a significant performance cost. We prove the protocol's critical advantage as a performance benchmark: its primary communication cost scales as $O(n^2)$, a dramatic improvement over quantum-native alternatives ($O(n^4)$), establishing a high-performance goal for future quantum-secured anonymity systems."}

Experimental results show that FPQE performs comparably to conventional methods on simple datasets such as MNIST, while achieving clear improvements on more complex ones, outperforming PCA and pruning based encodings by up to 10.2\\% accuracy on Cifar-10. The performance gain grows with data complexity, demonstrating FPQE's ability to preserve high-level structural information across diverse visual domains. By maintaining fidelity during classical to quantum transformation, FPQE establishes a scalable and hardware efficient foundation for high-quality quantum representation learning."}

To address this issue, a quantum backdoor attack detection framework called QSentry is proposed, in which a quantum Measurement Clustering method is introduced to detect backdoors by identifying statistical anomalies in measurement outputs. It is demonstrated that QSentry can effectively detect anomalous distributions induced by backdoor samples with extensive experiments. It achieves a 75.8% F1 score even under a 1% poisoning rate, and further improves to 85.7% and 93.2% as the poisoning rate increases to 5% and 10%, respectively. The integration of silhouette coefficients and relative cluster size enable QSentry to precisely isolate backdoor samples, yielding estimates that closely match actual poisoning ratios. Evaluations under various quantum attack scenarios demonstrate that QSentry delivers superior robustness and accuracy compared with three state-of-the-art detection methods.

Rather than relying on generation of multiphoton states, our approach directly exploits vacuum-one-photon number superposition states created under resonant excitation. By delocalizing this superposition via a beam splitter, we realize time-bin entanglement and observe a clear violation of the Clauser-Horn-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality using Franson-type interferometry.

Dynamic, key-aware routing algorithms have been shown to reduce service rejection rates by 25-40% compared to static shortest-path methods by incorporating real-time key pool availability and link error rates. Multi-path strategies improve resilience against trusted-node compromise by distributing keys across disjoint routes, albeit with an increase in key consumption of 30-60%. SDN-based orchestration frameworks emerge as essential enablers of flexible, QoS-aware routing for hybrid networks integrating terrestrial fibers and intermittent satellite links.

Our approach includes, as special cases, unravelings of arbitrary dynamics in the Heisenberg picture, evolutions interpolating between fully Lindblad and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian generators, and equations employed in the derivation of full counting statistics, for which we show it can be used to obtain the moments of the associated probability distribution. The framework is suitable for both trace-decreasing and trace-increasing processes through stochastic disappearance and replication of the stochastic realizations, and it is compatible with different unraveling schemes and with reverse jumps in the non-Markovian regime.

To improve reliability in such settings, we study an adaptive diversity strategy for discrete-variable QuMIMO systems based on universal asymmetric cloning at the transmitter and probabilistic purification at the receiver. An input qubit is encoded into M approximate clones, transmitted over an N x N multi-mode quantum channel, and recovered through a purification map optimized using available channel state information (CSI). For the given cloning asymmetry parameters, we derive an eigenvalue-based expression for the decoder-optimal end-to-end fidelity in the form of a generalized Rayleigh quotient, which enables efficient tuning of the cloner without iterative optimization. As a design choice, we employ semidefinite program (SDP) to construct the purification map for only a targeted success probability p. This numerical framework is used to study fixed-noise, dimension-scaling noise, and stochastic depolarization regimes. A cloning asymmetry index is introduced to quantify the distribution of quantum information across the multiple subchannels across these operating conditions. The results show that the proposed scheme yields significant fidelity gains in crosstalk-dominated settings and automatically adapts to channel symmetry and channel conditions.

Although solving this issue for an arbitrary problem is inherently a hard task, we address this challenge for a specific problem in the field of telecommunications, the multi-frequency antenna placement problem, by introducing a constraint-preserving quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA). To this aim, we construct a quantum circuit that prepares an initial state comprising an equal superposition of all feasible solutions, and define a custom mixer that preserves both the one-hot encoding constraint for vertex coloring and the cardinality constraint on the number of antennas. This scheme can be extended to a broader range of applications characterized by similar constraints. We first benchmark the performance of this quantum algorithm against a basic version of QAA, demonstrating superior performance in terms of feasibility and success probability. We then apply this algorithm to large problem sizes with hundreds of variables using a constraint-aware decomposition method based on the SPLIT framework.

We perform the first experimental demonstration of non-local magic in a superconducting Quantum Processing Unit (QPU). Direct access to the QPU device enables us to identify and characterize the dominant noise mechanisms intrinsic to the quantum hardware. We observe excellent agreement between theory and experiment without the need for any free parameter in the noise modeling of our system and shows the experimental capability of harnessing both local and non-local magic resources separately, thereby offering a promising path towards more reliable pre-fault-tolerant quantum devices and to advance hardware-aware research in quantum information in the near term.

This study presents a novel variant of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) designed to address the task scheduling problem formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) model. The proposed method, referred to as Quantum Time Interval Scheduler (QTIS), integrates an ancilla-assisted quantum circuit to dynamically detect and penalize overlapping tasks, enhancing the enforcement of scheduling constraints. Two complementary implementations are explored for overlap detection: a quantum approach based on RY rotations and CCNOT gates, and a classical alternative relying on preprocessed interval comparisons. QTIS decomposes the problem Hamiltonian, Hp, into two components, each parameterized by a distinct angle. The first component encodes the objective function, while the second captures penalty terms associated with overlapping intervals, which are controlled by the auxiliary circuit. Subsequently, three minimization strategies are evaluated: standard QAOA, T-QAOA, and HT-QAOA, showing that employing separate parameters for the different components of the problem Hamiltonian leads to lower energy values and improved solution quality. Results confirm the efficiency of QTIS in scheduling tasks with fixed temporal windows while minimizing conflicts, demonstrating its potential to advance hybrid quantum-classical optimization in complex scheduling environments."}

One possible implementation is using a variant of the DLCZ-scheme by combining atomic-ensemble memories and linear optics with spontaneous parametric down conversion (SPDC) sources. As we edge closer to the realization of such a technology, the complete details of the underlying components become crucial. In this paper we consider the impact of the multimode emission from the SPDC source on quantum repeaters based on the DLCZ-scheme. We consider two cases, driving the SPDC using short Gaussian pulses and continuously. For pulsed driving, we find that the use of very narrow laser pulses to drive SPDC source is crucial to obtain high fidelity end-to-end entangled states but this puts demands on the peak intensity. By introducing a maximally allowed laser intensity, we find optimal pulse widths for each swap depth. For continuous driving, we find the temporal acceptance window of clicks relative to the heralding time to be a crucial parameter, and we can similarly optimize the acceptance window for each swap depth. For both cases, we thus identify optimal parameters given experimental limitations and aims. We have thus provided helpful knowledge towards the realization of long distance entanglement generation using the DLCZ-scheme."}

This paper demonstrates a fundamental incompatibility between traditional agent-based modeling (ABM) implementations and quantum optimization frameworks like Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). Using Schelling's segregation model as a case study, we show that the standard practice of directly translating ABM state observations into QUBO formulations not only fails to deliver quantum advantage, but actively undermines computational efficiency. The fundamental issue is architectural. Traditional ABM implementations entail observing the state of the system at each iteration, systematically destroying the quantum superposition required for computational advantage. Through analysis of Schelling's segregation dynamics on lollipop networks, we demonstrate how abandoning the QUBO reduction paradigm and instead reconceptualizing the research question, from \"simulate agent dynamics iteratively until convergence\" to \"compute minimum of agent moves required for global satisfaction\", enables a faster classical solution. This structural reconceptualization yields an algorithm that exploits network symmetries obscured in traditional ABM simulations and QUBO formulations. It establishes a new lower bound which quantum approaches must outperform to achieve advantage. Our work emphasizes that progress in quantum agent-based modeling does not require forcing classical ABM implementations into quantum frameworks. Instead, it should focus on clarifying when quantum advantage is structurally possible, developing best-in-class classical baselines through problem analysis, and fundamentally reformulating research questions rather than preserving classical iterative state change observation paradigms."}
