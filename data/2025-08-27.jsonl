We define QNODEs as the evolution of finite-dimensional\nquantum systems, and QNPDEs as infinite-dimensional (continuous-variable)\ncounterparts, governed by generalised Schrodinger-type Hamiltonian dynamics\nwith unitary evolution, coupled with a corresponding loss function. Notably,\nthis formalism permits gradient estimation using an adjoint-state method,\nfacilitating efficient learning of quantum dynamics, and other dynamics that\ncan be mapped (relatively easily) to quantum dynamics. Using this method, we\npresent quantum algorithms for computing gradients with and without time\ndiscretisation, enabling efficient gradient computation that would otherwise be\nless efficient on classical devices.\n  The formalism subsumes a wide array of applications, including quantum state\npreparation, Hamiltonian learning, learning dynamics in open systems, and the\nlearning of both autonomous and non-autonomous classical ODEs and PDEs. In many\nof these applications, we consider scenarios where the Hamiltonian has\nrelatively few tunable parameters, yet the corresponding classical simulation\nremains inefficient, making quantum approaches advantageous for gradient\nestimation.

It uses\nquantum-assisted Column Generation (CG) based on Quantum Adiabatic Algorithms\n(QAA) to sample high-quality maximum-weight independent sets (MWIS), reducing\nthe need to repeatedly solve NP-hard PSPs. The adapted branching strategy\nleverages quantum-generated independent sets to explore fewer nodes, tighten\nlower bounds, and converge faster. A classical primal heuristic rapidly builds\nfeasible solutions from quantum-generated sets, avoiding unnecessary quantum\ncalls or additional Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solves. Compared with our\nprior Hybrid Column Generation (HCG) and Branch-and-Bound through maximal\nIndependent Set (BBQ-mIS), QCBP improves both quantum-resource utilization and\nsolution quality.
