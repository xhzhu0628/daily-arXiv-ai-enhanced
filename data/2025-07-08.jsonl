Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms\nwith intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon\ninteractions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom\nsensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous,\nsecond-quantized framework for describing multi-$\\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity,\nencompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode\nelectromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic\napplication of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators,\nenabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective\nHamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian\nnot only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by\ncontributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects\nfrom counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than\nconventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a\nparticle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly\nfrom the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and\natomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an\nanalysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a\ntypical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations.\nFurthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical\nHong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration,\nutilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of\nRaman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a\nmicroscopic model of the effect."}
