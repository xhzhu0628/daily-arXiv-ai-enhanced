Recently proposed QLDPC codes, such as those\nby Panteleev and Kalachev, offer constant-rate encoding and asymptotic goodness\nbut introduce higher decoding complexity. To address such limitation, this work\npresents a parallelized belief propagation decoder leveraging syndrome\ninformation on commodity GPU hardware. Parallelism was exploited to maximize\nperformance within the limits of target latency, allowing decoding latencies\nunder $50$ $\\mu$s for [[$784$, $24$, $24$]] codes and as low as $23.3$ $\\mu$s\nfor smaller codes, meeting the tight timing constraints of superconducting\nqubit cycles. These results show that real-time, scalable decoding of\nasymptotically good quantum codes is achievable using widely available\ncommodity hardware, advancing the feasibility of fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputation beyond surface codes."}
