The established method for suppressing QRPN is\nthe injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline\nfilter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity.

However, due to the\nunavoidable dark counts in single-photon detectors (SPDs), it has long been\nconstrained by the rapid increase of the quantum bit error rate (QBER) induced\nby empty signals at the receiver, which prevents it from extending to\narbitrarily long distances. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an\nempty-signal detection (ESD) strategy for quantum communication receivers,\nwhich integrates state preparation, controlled gates, and multi-copy analysis\ninto a single block. The core idea is to encode photon-existence information\nonto an auxiliary degree of freedom (DOF) that is independent of the\nmessage-encoding DOF, allowing the receiver, through controlled gates on the\nauxiliary DOFs and subsequent measurements on the auxiliary copies, to verify\nthe non-emptiness of the received signal without disturbing the transmitted\nmessage. In this way, empty signals can be excluded from further communication\nprocessing, thereby resolving the QBER explosion problem caused by empty\nsignals. Moreover, the proposed design relies solely on practical, even\ncommercially available, devices, and can be realized under current\ntechnological conditions. Therefore, this study provides a framework for\nachieving arbitrarily long-distance quantum communication by allowing a lossy\nchannel to be asymptotically regarded as lossless in QBER estimations, and\noffers a proof-of-principle demonstration that secure quantum communications\ncan be extended to arbitrary distances under current technology."}
