The model can be applied\nto a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear\nproperties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography\ntasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by\nour neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.\nIntriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend\nmeasurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk\nproperties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have\nindependently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without\nhaving been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics."}

Here, we introduce a complete fault-tolerant\narchitecture for CE CSS codes based on dual-rail concatenation. After showing\nthat transversal CNOT gates violate CE code constraints, we introduce\nCE-preserving logical CNOT gates and modified Shor- and Steane-type syndrome\nextraction schemes using zero-controlled NOT gates and CE-compatible ancilla.\nThis enables fault-tolerant syndrome-extraction circuits fully compatible with\nCE constraints. We also present an extended stabilizer simulation algorithm\nthat efficiently tracks both stochastic and collective coherent noise. Using\nour framework, we identify minimal CE codes, including the $[[12,1,3]]$ and\n$[[14,3,3]]$ codes, and demonstrate that the $[[12,1,3]]$ code achieves strong\nperformance under coherent noise. Our results establish the first complete\nFTQEC framework for CE codes, demonstrating their robustness to coherent noise.\nThis highlights the potential of CE codes as a possible solution for quantum\nprocessors dominated by collective coherent noise."}

The system eigenspectrum is symmetric about a\ncritical point, $|\\vec{b}| = 0$, with four of the spectral components varying\napproximately linearly with the magnetic field and four exhibiting a nonlinear\ndependence. Under the adiabatic approximation and for appropriate initial\nstates, we show that the sensor's response to a zero-mean signal is such that\nbelow a threshold, $|\\vec{b}| < b_\\mathrm{th}$, the sensor does not respond to\nthe signal, whereas above the threshold, the sensor acts as a detector that the\nsignal has occurred. This thresholded response is approximately\nomnidirectional. Moreover, when deployed in an entangled multisensor\nconfiguration, the sensor achieves sensitivity at the Heisenberg limit. Such\ndetectors could be useful both as standalone units for signal detection above a\nnoise threshold and in two- or three-dimensional arrays, analogous to a quantum\nbubble chamber, for applications such as particle track detection and\nlong-baseline telescopy."}

In particular, Suzuki's recursive\nmethod is explored to achieve improved error scaling. Through theoretical\nanalysis and illustrative examples, the advantages and limitations of these\ntechniques are discussed, with an emphasis on their application to $k$-local\nHamiltonians and their role in overcoming classical computational bottlenecks.\nThe work concludes with a brief overview of current advances and open\nchallenges in Hamiltonian simulation."}
