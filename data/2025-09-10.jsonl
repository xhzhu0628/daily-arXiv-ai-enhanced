NGCC asserts that in any single-world\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics that permits bounded-disturbance\n(epsilon-counterfactual) measurements, one cannot have a globally consistent\nassignment of outcomes for a closed network of counterfactual inferences. In\nessence, if multiple observers perform nearly interaction-free measurements\naround a closed loop (or any network containing cycles), their locally certain\nconclusions cannot all be mutually consistent in a single classical narrative.\nWe formalize this as a circular consistency theorem and a family of exclusivity\ninequalities that any non-contextual, single-world hidden-variable model must\nsatisfy. These constraints extend the CIFP beyond an n-lab ring to arbitrary\nnetwork topologies, enforcing an NGCC bound on joint outcome probabilities.\nQuantum mechanics violates these bounds for sufficiently small epsilon,\nimplying that no single-world, non-contextual model (even one allowing slight\nmeasurement disturbance) can reproduce the quantum predictions in such\nscenarios.

In this work, we correct technical issues with this and\nother prior analysis, and substantially extend the scope of nonlinear dynamical\nsystems that can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer in a number of\nways. Firstly, we extend the existing results from purely dissipative systems\nto a much broader class of stable systems, and show that every quadratic\nLyapunov function for the linearized system corresponds to an independent\n$R$-number criterion for the convergence of the Carlemen scheme.

This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be\nincreased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same\nunit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an\noptimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth,\nwhile equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this\nmethod does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at\ndifferent pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve\ngains above 20 dB.

First, we develop a cyclic\ncompilation algorithm that localizes all two-particle interaction terms in a\ngeneral fermionic Hamiltonian that contains $\\mathcal{O}(n^4)$ such terms,\nusing only $\\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ auxiliary Majorana-swap gates, where $n$ is the\nnumber of fermionic modes. This algorithm targets all-to-all qubit connectivity\n(e.g., trapped-ion processors) and can be used to compactify UCCGSD circuits.\nSecond, we design a Majorana swap network for the UpCCGSD variational ansatz,\nwhich is already more compact than UCCGSD. Our network achieves asymptotic\nreductions in circuit depth and gate count of approximately 50% and 20%,\nrespectively, under all-to-all connectivity.
