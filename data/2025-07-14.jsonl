A simple example is the\nfar-field speckle pattern in 1D light scattering: classical light forms 1D\nspeckles defined by the numerical aperture, whereas biphoton scattering depends\nin addition on the photon correlation length, forming 2D elliptical speckles.\nTo date, the behavior of quantum speckles for shorter propagation distances has\nnot been considered. We remedy this here by considering the paraxial evolution\nof two-photon entanglement at arbitrary propagation distances from an isotropic\nscatterer. We show, theoretically, numerically, and experimentally, that the\ntwo length scales of the biphoton introduce a new Fresnel regime between the\nconventional near and far fields. Further, we show that the quantum near field\nis characterized by speckles with a square shape that remain constant during\npropagation. In contrast, the intermediate regime can be engineered to have a\nconstant speckle size along the sum coordinate but a linearly expanding speckle\nsize along the difference coordinate, with a speckle shape that transitions\nfrom square to elliptical.

Recent\nresearch also suggests a significant connection between the Wehrl entropy and\nmany-body quantum entanglement in spin systems. We investigate the statistical\ninterpretation of the Husimi function and the Wehrl entropy, taking the system\nof $N$ spin-1/2 particles as an example. Due to the completeness of coherent\nstates, the Husimi function and Wehrl entropy can be explained via the positive\noperator-valued measurement (POVM) theory, although the coherent states are not\na set of orthonormal basis.
