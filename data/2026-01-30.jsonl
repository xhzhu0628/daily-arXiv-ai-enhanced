Using a modular integration framework connecting a C++ circuit optimizer with Lindblad-based pulse simulation, we systematically evaluate the fidelity impact of four optimization passes: gate cancellation, commutation, rotation merging, and identity elimination, on IQM Garnet hardware parameters. Our simulation campaign spanning 371 circuit runs reveals that gate cancellation provides the most significant improvement (68\\% of circuits improved, 14,024 gates eliminated), while pulse duration exhibits the strongest negative correlation with process fidelity ($r = -0.74$, $R^2 = 0.55$). We validate these findings through hardware execution on the IQM Resonance Garnet 20-qubit processor, demonstrating 70\\% gate reduction on QFT circuits with 100\\% job success rate (8 executions).

In this work, we develop a trajectory-based description of photon dynamics formulated in an extended complex space within the relativistic quantum Hamilton Jacobi framework. In this approach, photon motion is represented by complex trajectories whose real projections describe propagation, while imaginary components encode oscillatory structure. We show that momentum eigenstates correspond to straight line trajectories with uniform propagation at the speed of light, whereas superposition states lead to nontrivial quantum potentials and oscillatory motion in the complex plane. Extending the analysis to complex two dimensional space reveals richer dynamical behavior, including propagating wave like trajectories and standing wave like patterns in real projections. Energy momentum consistency is verified through an internal coherence analysis based on projected standing wave wavelengths. Rather than introducing new dynamical laws or additional physical dimensions, the complex space is employed as an interpretational framework that renders wave like and particle like aspects as complementary projections of a single underlying motion. The results suggest a unified geometric perspective on wave particle duality, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum mechanics."}

Over the past decades several authors have analyzed the Breit equation to obtain numerically or by approximation an estimation of the energy levels. Various approaches have been used and no determination of the energy levels currently exists that is directly based on the second order Heun differential equation derived.\n  The aim of this work is to provide a method of calculation that can be used to numerically calculate the energy levels for various spin states to high accuracy.\n  From the Breit equation, we derive the corresponding second-order Heun differential equation and continued fraction from which the eigenvalues can be determined very accurately. Next, we present a novel method based on the Green function method, which leads to a semi-infinite determinant from which we are able to obtain the numerical values of the eigenvalues by direct calculation.\n  Using suitable numerical methods for the direct calculation of the continued fraction and the semi-infinite determinant, we show that both methods are consistent within 25 digits of accuracy. We show that the correct energy levels for the Dirac equation follow from our results by a suitable mapping of the variables.\n  The results are in total agreement with earlier calculations found in the literature and extend this by several digits of additional accuracy. The condition on the determinant giving the energy levels provides a rich structure that is promising in extending the results of this work."}

In this study, the dispatch problem for such micro-mobility services is formulated as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, enabling efficient solving through QA. Furthermore, the proposed formulation incorporates historical usage data to enhance operational efficiency. Specifically, customer arrival frequencies and destination distributions are modeled into the QUBO formulation through a Bayesian approach, which guides the allocation of vacant vehicles to designated stations for waiting and charging. Simulation experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, with comparisons to conventional formulations such as the vehicle routing problem. Additionally, the performance of QA is compared with that of classical solvers to reveal its potential advantages for the proposed dispatch formulation. The effect of reverse annealing on improving solution quality is also investigated."}

We begin with the well-known model of energy dephasing, associated with energy diffusion. We then turn to master equations containing a double anticommutator with the system Hamiltonian, recently derived in the context of noisy non-Hermitian systems. For both classes of double-bracket equations, we provide a gradient-flow representation of the dynamics. We analyze the classical limit of the resulting evolutions for harmonic and driven anharmonic quantum oscillators, considering both classical and nonclassical initial states. The dynamics is characterized through the evolution of several observables as well as the Wigner logarithmic negativity. We conclude by extending our analysis to generalized master equations involving higher-order nested brackets, which provide a time-continuous description of spectral filtering techniques commonly used in the numerical analysis of quantum systems."}

To address this limitation, we introduce phantom codes-quantum error-correcting codes that realize entangling gates between all logical qubits in a code block purely through relabelling of physical qubits during compilation, yielding perfect fidelity with no spatial or temporal overhead. We present a systematic study of such codes. First, we identify phantom codes using complementary numerical and analytical approaches. We exhaustively enumerate all $2.71 \\times 10^{10}$ inequivalent CSS codes up to $n=14$ and identify additional instances up to $n=21$ via SAT-based methods. We then construct higher-distance phantom-code families using quantum Reed-Muller codes and the binarization of qudit codes. Across all identified codes, we characterize other supported fault-tolerant logical Clifford and non-Clifford operations. Second, through end-to-end noisy simulations with state preparation, full QEC cycles, and realistic physical error rates, we demonstrate scalable advantages of phantom codes over the surface code across multiple tasks. We observe a one-to-two order-of-magnitude reduction in logical infidelity at comparable qubit overhead for GHZ-state preparation and Trotterized many-body simulation tasks, given a modest preselection acceptance rate. Our work establishes phantom codes as a viable architectural route to fault-tolerant quantum computation with scalable benefits for workloads with dense local entangling structure, and introduces general tools for systematically exploring the broader landscape of quantum error-correcting codes."}

We argue that this boundary-drive induced non-equilibrium transition (as witnessed through the correlation matrix) is driven by a resonance mechanism whereby the drive frequency bridges bulk energy gaps, allowing boundary-injected particles and holes to propagate and mediate long-range correlations into the bulk. We also numerically establish that when the drive bridges a particle-hole gap, the induced long-range order scales as a power law with the bulk pairing potential ($χ\\sim γ^2$). Our results highlight the potential of localized coherent driving for generating macroscopic order in open quantum systems."}

The model is based on the Stern-Gerlach Interferometer (SGI) scheme, which utilises linear and quadratic magnetic fields to generate a harmonic potential (linear magnetic field) and a non-linear potential (non-linear/quadratic magnetic field). By incorporating two-dimensional dynamics into the model, we provide a more realistic and accurate depiction of nanoparticle dynamics in linear and inverted harmonic potentials and explore the interaction between motion in a two-dimensional plane. Importantly, we derive the equations of motion for the rotational degrees of freedom, i.e. libration, precession, and rotation. The results show that adding a magnetic-field bias term to the magnetic-field profile in the linear stage affects the classical equations of motion but does not affect the width of the wave packet. Moreover, the libration mode always forms a harmonic potential at each stage because the applied initial angular velocity is dominated by the nanoparticle's defect axis, making it more stable in the presence of the trap frequency in the orthogonal direction along the axis that enables the creation of a macroscopic quantum superposition."}

Neural-network quantum states, such as Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), can efficiently parameterize individual many-body quantum states and have been successfully used for QST. However, existing approaches are point-wise and require retraining at every parameter value in a phase diagram. We introduce a parametric QST framework based on a hypernetwork that conditions an RBM on Hamiltonian control parameters, enabling a single model to represent an entire family of quantum ground states. Applied to the transverse-field Ising model, our HyperRBM achieves high-fidelity reconstructions from local Pauli measurements on 1D and 2D lattices across both phases and through the critical region. Crucially, the model accurately reproduces the fidelity susceptibility and identifies the quantum phase transition without prior knowledge of the critical point. These results demonstrate that hypernetwork-modulated neural quantum states provide an efficient and scalable route to tomographic reconstruction across full phase diagrams."}

Similarly, weak-value amplification enhances a weak coupling's detectability. The technique exhibits counterintuitive properties captured by a retrocausal model. Using the third strategy, one simulates closed timelike curves, worldlines that loop back on themselves in time. The fourth strategy involves indefinite causal order, which characterises channels applied in a superposition of orderings. We review these four strategies, which we unify under the heading of time-reverse metrology. We also outline opportunities for this toolkit in quantum metrology; quantum information science; quantum foundations; atomic, molecular, and optical physics; and solid-state physics."}

This goes beyond Abelian topological order (TO) such as the toric code, as its anyons lack internal structure. However, the simplest non-Abelian generalizations of the toric code do not support universality via braiding alone. Here we demonstrate that such minimally non-Abelian TOs can be made universal by treating anyon fusion as a computational primitive. We prepare a 54-qubit TO wavefunction associated with the smallest non-Abelian group, $S_3$, on Quantinuum's H2 quantum processor. This phase of matter exhibits cyclic anyon fusion rules, known to underpin universality, which we evidence by trapping a single non-Abelian anyon on the torus. We encode logical qutrits in the nonlocal fusion space of non-Abelian fluxes and, by combining an entangling braiding operation with anyon charge measurements, realize a universal topological gate set and read-out, which we further demonstrate by topologically preparing a magic state. This work establishes $S_3$ TO as simple enough to be prepared efficiently, yet rich enough to enable universal topological quantum computation."}

Typically in such models, the bulk geometry is determined by solving Einstein's equations. Here, we simply choose a bulk geometry, then discretize the geometry into a coupling graph comprising bulk and boundary nodes.

To isolate correlation geometry from payoff optimization, we introduce the Hidden-Field Coordination (HFC) model, which enforces identical information access and no-signaling constraints across strategies. Using information-theoretic diagnostics, we compare classical shared-randomness baselines with an entanglement-mediated strategy based on multipartite W states and a strictly local Spontaneous Leader Election rule. Within the restricted symmetric shared-latent baseline studied here, increasing total correlation is achieved primarily by driving actions toward alignment (copying), which also increases pairwise coincidence (collisions). By contrast, the quantum strategy realizes a collision-suppressing coordination regime: it preserves global dependence while reducing pairwise coincidence below the independent (product) baseline induced by the common marginal distribution. This produces a geometric separation in the joint-action distribution. Classical baselines concentrate probability near the diagonal of action equality, whereas the entanglement-mediated mapping occupies an offset-diagonal region associated with relational roles. Accordingly, the entanglement signature in this setting is not higher correlation magnitude; total-correlation differentials can be negative relative to the classical copying optimum. Instead, it reflects a change in dependence geometry that supports robust anti-coordination."}

Depending on the setup, the detectors are positioned either parallel or orthogonal to the boundary, with their energy gaps chosen to satisfy the hierarchy $Ω_C\\geq Ω_B\\geq Ω_A$. Our analysis reveals that decreasing the detector-boundary separation leads to a monotonic degradation of quantum coherence, whereas the same boundary effect can simultaneously preserve and even amplify the harvested quantum entanglement. Moreover, when the detectors possess distinct energy gaps, coherence extraction is further inhibited; strikingly, such non-identical configurations substantially enhance the efficiency of entanglement harvesting and markedly extend the range of detector separations over which non-negligible entanglement can be generated. Nevertheless, the harvesting of nonlocal quantum coherence is achievable over a significantly broader range of detector separations than that of quantum entanglement. Despite exhibiting similar overall behavior, orthogonal detector configurations outperform parallel ones in coherence harvesting, highlighting the quantitative influence of detector geometry. Overall, our study reveals a hierarchical distinction between quantum coherence and entanglement as operational resources in structured vacuum fields: quantum coherence is not only more readily accessible across space but also more robust than entanglement, whereas entanglement exhibits richer features and can be selectively activated and enhanced through boundary effects and detector non-uniformity."}

Many quantum optical phenomena can be characterized by the two-time quantum correlation function $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$, which describes the photon statistics of emitted radiation. However, the critical task of determining $g^{(2)}(t,τ)$ becomes intractable for large emitter ensembles due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of emitters. Here, we analyse and benchmark two approximate numerical sampling methods applicable to emitter arrays embedded within electromagnetic environments, which generally provide upper and lower bounds for $g^{(2)}(t,0)$. We also introduce corrections to these methods (termed offset corrections) that significantly improve the quality of the predictions. The optimal choice of method depends on the total number of emitters, such that taken together, the two approaches provide accurate descriptions across a broad range of important regimes. This work therefore provides new theoretical tools for studying the well-known yet complex phenomenon of superradiance in large ensembles of quantum emitters."}

As the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states with extremely long lifetime appear around the resonant frequency and form a continuum band. In stark contrast to the fully disordered waveguide QED where all states are localized, we analytically find that the fraction of localized states is up to $(3-\\sqrt{5})/2$ when the modulation frequency is $(1+\\sqrt{5})/2$. The localized and delocalized states can be related to excitation in flat and curved inverse energy bands under the approximation of large-period modulation. When the quasiperiodic strength is weak, an extended subradiant state can support the transmission of a photon. However, as the quasiperiodic strength increases, localized subradiant states can completely block the transmission of a single photon in resonance with the subradiant states, and enhance the overall reflection. At a fixed quasiperiodic strength, we also find mobility edge in transmission spectrum, below and above which the transmission is either turned on and off as system size increases.

Away from the critical regime, the evolution is designed to follow the threshold of adiabatic breakdown, which we characterize by an adiabatic coefficient $ζ\\proptoτ_Q^α$. As a consequence, the total evolution time exhibits a sublinear power-law dependence on $τ_Q$, and the conventional linear quench protocol is recovered in the limit $α\\rightarrow\\infty$. We apply the OAI protocol to the transverse Ising chain and numerically determine the minimum value of $ζ$. We further investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics in the presence of a noisy field that can induce anti-Kibble-Zurek behavior, leading to more defects for slower ramps. Within the OAI protocol, the optimal quench time that minimizes defects obeys an altered universal power-law scaling with the noise strength. Finally, we generalize the OAI protocol to incorporate nonlinear Kibble-Zurek scaling."}

Numerous protocols exist for benchmarking devices before running actual algorithms. In this work, we show that both physical and logical errors of fault-tolerant circuits can even be characterized in-situ using syndrome data. To achieve this, we map general fault-tolerant Clifford circuits to subsystem codes using the spacetime code formalism and develop a scheme for estimating Pauli noise in Clifford circuits using syndrome data. We give necessary and sufficient conditions for the learnability of physical and logical noise from given syndrome data, and show that we can accurately predict logical fidelities from the same data. Importantly, our approach requires only a polynomial sample size, even when the logical error rate is exponentially suppressed by the code distance, and thus gives an exponential advantage against methods that use only logical data such as direct fidelity estimation.

A key challenge is the coherent manipulation of nearby nuclear spins, which serve as quantum memories and auxiliary qubits but conventionally require additional high-power RF fields which increase the experimental complexity and overall power consumption. Finding systems where both electron and nuclear spins can be controlled using a single MW source is therefore highly desirable. Here, using a modified divacancy center in silicon carbide, we show that coherent control of a coupled nuclear spin is possible without any RF fields. Instead, MW pulses driving the electron spin also manipulate the nuclear spin through hyperfineenhanced effects, activated by a precisely tilted external magnetic field. We demonstrate high-fidelity nuclear-spin control, achieving 89% two-qubit tomography fidelity and nearly T1-limited nuclear coherence times.

We identify four different operational regimes, classified according to the plasmon-like versus fluxon-like nature of the qutrit excitations. Highly tunable on-site interactions are complemented by correlated single-particle hopping, pair hopping and non-local interactions, which naturally emerge and have different weights in the four regimes. Dispersive corrections and decoherence are also analyzed. We investigate the rich ground-state phase diagram of qutrit arrays and propose practical dynamical experiments to probe the different regimes.

Although transmon type qubits are designed and manufactured routinely in the range of a few Giga-Hertz, normally from 4 to 6 GHz (and, at times, up to around 10GHz), achieving higher-frequency operation has challenges and entails special design and manufacturing considerations. This report presents the proposal and preliminary design of an 8-qubit transmon (with possible upgrade to up to 72 qubits on a chip) architecture working beyond an operation frequency of 10GHz, as well as presents a new connection topology. The current design spans a range of around 11 to 13.5 GHz (with a possible full range of 9-12GHz at the moment), with a central optimal operating frequency of 12.0 GHz, with the aim to possibly achieve a stable, compact and low-charge-noise operation, as lowest as possible as per the existing fabrication techniques. The aim is to achieve average relaxation times of up to 1.9ms with average quality factors of up to 2.75 x 10^7 after trials, while exploiting the new advances in superconducting junction manufacturing using tantalum and niobium/aluminum/aluminum oxide tri-layer structures on high-resistivity silicon substrates (carried out elsewhere by other groups and referred in this report)."}

Large-bandgap van der Waals materials such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) host stable room-temperature single-photon emitters with narrow linewidths across a broad spectral range. However, cooperative radiative effects in this system have not been previously explored. Here we demonstrate collective emission from quantum-emitter ensembles in hBN layers when the emitters are nearly indistinguishable and positioned within a sub-wavelength proximity. Using confocal microscopy and a Hanbury Brown-Twiss (HBT) configuration, we identify both isolated emitters and ensembles activated by localized electron-beam irradiation. Time-resolved photoluminescence measurements reveal a superlinear intensity enhancement and a pronounced acceleration of the radiative decay in tightly confined ensembles, with lifetimes approaching the temporal resolution of our experimental system (about 500 ps), compared to approximately 1.85 ns for single emitters or large, spatially extended ensembles. Complementary second-order photon-correlation measurements exhibit sub-Poissonian antidip consistent with emission from a few indistinguishable emitters. The simultaneous observation of lifetime shortening and enhanced emission provides direct evidence of cooperative emission at room temperature, achieved without optical cavities or cryogenic cooling. These results establish optically active defect ensembles in hBN as a scalable solid-state platform for engineered collective quantum optics in two-dimensional materials, opening avenues toward ultrabright superradiant light sources and nonclassical photonic states for quantum technologies."}

This lively debate is deeply interwoven with the question of whether entanglement studies can prove the quantum nature of gravity. However, the answer to this fundamental question depends crucially on which hybrid quantum-classical theory is used. In this letter, we demonstrate that entanglement by a classical mediator is possible within the framework of hybrid van Hove theory, showing that existing no-go theorems on that matter do not universally apply to hybrid theories in general. After briefly recapitulating the key features of the hybrid van Hove theory, we show this using the example of two quantum spins coupled by a classical harmonic oscillator. By deriving the spin density matrix for this scenario and comparing it to its equivalent for a pure quantum system, we show that entanglement between the two spins is generated in both cases. Conclusively, this is illustrated by presenting the purity and concurrence of the spin-spin system as a decisive measure for entanglement. Our results further imply that quantum entanglement studies cannot rule out consistent quantum theories featuring classical gravity."}

Here, we realize a hardware-efficient biased-erasure qubit encoded in the vacuum and two-photon Fock states of a single microwave cavity. The qubit exhibits an erasure bias ratio of over 265. By using a transmon ancilla for logical measurements and mid-circuit erasure detections, we achieve logical state assignment errors below 1% and convert over 99.3% leakage errors into detected erasures. After postselection against erasures, we achieve effective logical relaxation and dephasing rates of $(6.2~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$ and $(3.1~\\mathrm{ms})^{-1}$, respectively, which exceed the erasure error rate by factors of 31 and 15, establishing a strong error hierarchy within the logical subspace. These postselected error rates indicate a coherence gain of about 6.0 beyond the break-even point set by the best physical qubit encoded in the two lowest Fock states in the cavity.

We use the Lasserre Sum-of-Squares (SOS) hierarchy from optimization theory to relax the decoding problem. This approach creates a sequence of Semidefinite Programs (SDPs). Lower levels of the hierarchy are faster but approximate, while higher levels are slower but more accurate. We demonstrate that even low levels of this hierarchy significantly outperform standard Linear Programming relaxations. Our results on rotated surface codes and honeycomb color codes show that the SOS decoder approaches the performance of exact decoding.

It states that any logical operation on a $D$-dimensional topological stabiliser code that can be implemented by a short-depth circuit acts on the codespace as an element of the $D$-th level of the Clifford hierarchy. In recent years, a new type of quantum error correcting codes based on Pauli stabilisers, dubbed Floquet codes, has been introduced. In Floquet codes, syndrome measurements are arranged such that they dynamically generate a codespace at each time step. Here, we show that the BK theorem holds for a definition of Floquet codes based on locally conjugate stabiliser groups. Moreover, we introduce and define a class of generalised unitaries in Floquet codes that need not preserve the codespace at each time step, but that combined with the measurements constitute a valid logical operation. We derive a canonical form of these generalised unitaries and show that the BK theorem holds for them too."}

We derive a closed-form achievable rate region for the general EA bosonic MAC using high-order phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. Specifically, we demonstrate that in the low-photon regime the capacity region collapses into a rectangle, asymptotically matching the point-to-point capacity as multi-user interference vanishes. We also characterize an achievable covert throughput region, showing that entanglement assistance enables an aggregate throughput scaling of \\(O(\\sqrt{n} \\log n)\\) covert bits with the block length $n$ for both senders, surpassing the square-root law as in the point-to-point case. Our analysis reveals that the joint covertness constraint imposes a linear trade-off between the senders throughput."}

For semiconductor-based quantum platforms, initialisation is typically performed via slow microwave processes and usually requires cooling to temperatures where only the lowest quantum level is occupied. In silicon, boron atoms are the most common impurities. They bind holes in orbitals including an effective spin-3/2 ground state as well as excited states analogous to the Rydberg series for hydrogen. Here we show that initialisation temperature demands may be relaxed and speeds increased over a thousand-fold by importing, from atomic physics, the procedure of optical pumping via excited orbital states to preferentially occupy a target ground state spin. Spin relaxation within the orbital ground state of unstrained silicon is too fast to measure for conventional pulsed microwave technology, except at temperatures below 2 K, implying a need not only for fast state preparation but also fast state readout. Circularly polarised ~10 THz photon pulses from a free electron laser meet both needs at temperatures above 3 K: a 9 ps pulse enhances the population of one spin eigenstate for the \"1s\"-like ground state orbital, and the second interrogates this imbalance in spin population. Using parameters given by our data, we calculate that it should be possible to initialise 99% of spins for boron in strained silicon within 250 ps at 3 K. The speedup of both state preparation and measurement gained for THz rather than microwave photons should be explored for the many other solid state quantum systems hosting THz excitations potentially useful as intermediate states."}

The method leverages pre-computed QAOA angles, derived from depth-$p$ QAOA circuits on regular trees, to compute local expectation values and inform sequential greedy decisions that progressively build an independent set. This hybrid approach maintains shallow quantum circuit and avoids instance-specific parameter training, making it well-suited for implementation on current quantum hardware: we have implemented the algorithm on a 20 qubit IQM superconducting device to find independent sets in graphs with thousands of nodes. We perform tensor network simulations to evaluate the performance of the algorithm beyond the reach of current quantum hardware and compare to established classical heuristics. Our results show that even at low depth ($p=4$), the quantum-enhanced greedy method significantly outperforms purely classical greedy baselines as well as more sophisticated approximation algorithms. The modular structure of the algorithm and relatively low quantum resource requirements make it a compelling candidate for scalable, hybrid optimization in the NISQ era and beyond."}

Considering a relevant experimental example of a qubit interacting with a single bosonic mode playing the role of a finite bath, we show that all definitions of entropy production coincide at weak coupling. In the strong coupling regime, significant discrepancies emerge between the different entropy production rates, although some similarities in the overall behaviour remain. However, surprisingly, two of these definitions -- one based on local quantities of the system and the other on non-local quantities -- coincide exactly, even in the case of strong coupling. Finally, a high degree of correspondence is observed when memory effects characterized by P-divisibility are compared with the sign of all entropy production rates in the case of weak coupling. Such correspondence degrades at strong coupling, leading us to extend the concept of entropy production to the dynamical map. We show a perfect equivalence between the sign of this enlarged concept of entropy production and P-divisibility, both numerically and analytically, in the case of phase-covariant master equations."}

We introduce a hierarchy of integral probability metrics, termed MMD-$k$, which generalizes the maximum mean discrepancy to quantum ensembles and exhibit a strict trade-off between discriminative power and statistical efficiency as the moment order $k$ increases. For pure-state ensembles of size $N$, estimating MMD-$k$ using experimentally feasible SWAP-test-based estimators requires $Θ(N^{2-2/k})$ samples for constant $k$, and $Θ(N^3)$ samples to achieve full discriminative power at $k = N$. In contrast, the quantum Wasserstein distance attains full discriminative power with $Θ(N^2 \\log N)$ samples. These results provide principled guidance for the design of loss functions in quantum machine learning, which we illustrate in the training quantum denoising diffusion probabilistic models."}

A central question is how small a role quantum computers can play while still enabling provable learning advantages over classical methods. We study an especially restricted setting in which a quantum computer is used only as a feature extractor: it acts independently on individual data points, without access to labels or global dataset information, is available only to augment the training set, and is not available at deployment. Training and deployment are therefore carried out by fully classical learners on a dataset augmented with quantum-generated features. We formalize this model by adapting the classical framework of Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) to the quantum case, which we call Learning Under Quantum Privileged Information (LUQPI). Within this framework, we show that even such minimally involved quantum feature extraction, available only during training, can yield exponential quantum-classical separations for suitable concept classes and data distributions under reasonable computational assumptions. We further situate LUQPI within a taxonomy of related quantum and classical learning settings and show how standard classical machinery, most notably the SVM+ algorithm, can exploit quantum-augmented data. Finally, we present numerical experiments in a physically motivated many-body setting, where privileged quantum features are expectation values of observables on ground states, and observe consistent performance gains for LUQPI-style models over strong classical baselines."}

However, the scalability of conventional spin-based quantum architectures remains limited by direct microwave delivery, which introduces thermal noise, electromagnetic cross-talk, and design constraints for cryogenic, high-field, and distributed systems. In this work, we present a unified framework for RF-over-fiber (RFoF) control of optically accessible spins through RFoF optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectroscopy of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. The RFoF platform relies on an electro-optically modulated telecom-band laser that transmits microwave signals over fiber and a high-speed photodiode that recovers the RF waveform to drive NV center spin transitions. We obtain an RFoF efficiency of 1.81\\% at 2.90~GHz, corresponding to $P_{\\mathrm{RF,out}}=-0.7$~dBm. The RFoF architecture provides a path toward low-noise, thermally isolated, and cryo-compatible ODMR systems bridging conventional spin-based quantum sensing protocols with emerging distributed quantum technologies."}

Within this model, we combine Gray-encoded qudit-to-qubit mappings, qubit-wise commuting aggregation, and a multi-reference selected quantum Krylov fast-forwarding (sQKFF) hybrid algorithm to access long-time dynamics while remaining compatible with NISQ and early fault-tolerant hardware constraints. Numerical simulations demonstrate the computation of autocorrelation functions up to $\\sim100$ ns, together with microwave absorption spectra and the $\\ell_1$-norm of coherence, achieving 18-30$\\%$ reductions in gate counts and circuit depth for Trotterized time-evolution circuits compared to unoptimized implementations. Using the nitrogen vacancy center in diamond as a testbed, we benchmark the framework against classical simulations and identify the reference-state selection in sQKFF as the primary factor governing accuracy at fixed hardware cost. This methodology provides a flexible blueprint for using quantum computers to design, compare, and optimize solid-state spin-qubit technologies under experimentally realistic conditions."}
