Foligno et al. [Phys. Rev. X 13, 041008 (2023)] recently\nargued that the TE in chaotic 1d quantum circuits obeys linear (volume-law)\nscaling with evolution time. To reconcile this apparent high complexity of IM\nwith the rapid thermalization of local observables, here we study the relation\nbetween TE, non-Markovianity, and local temporal correlations for chaotic\nquantum baths. By exactly solving a random-unitary bath model, and bounding\ndistillable entanglement between future and past degrees of freedom, we argue\nthat TE is extensive for low enough bath growth rate, and it reflects genuine\nnon-Markovianity. This memory, however, is entirely contained in highly complex\ntemporal correlations, and its effect on few-point temporal correlators is\nnegligible. An IM coarse-graining procedure, reducing the allowed frequency of\nmeasurements of the probe system, results in a transition from volume- to\narea-law TE scaling. We demonstrate the generality of this TE transition in 1d\ncircuits by analyzing the kicked Ising model analytically at dual-unitary\npoints, as well as numerically away from them.

By seeding the classical\nMTS with high-quality initial states from digitized counterdiabatic quantum\noptimization (DCQO), our method suppresses the empirical time-to-solution\nscaling to $\\mathcal{O}(1.24^N)$ for sequence length $N \\in [27,37]$. This\nscaling surpasses the best-known classical heuristic $\\mathcal{O}(1.34^N)$ and\nimproves upon the $\\mathcal{O}(1.46^N)$ of the quantum approximate optimization\nalgorithm, achieving superior performance with a $6\\times$ reduction in circuit\ndepth. A two-stage bootstrap analysis confirms the scaling advantage and\nprojects a crossover point at $N \\gtrsim 47$, beyond which QE-MTS outperforms\nits classical counterpart. These results provide evidence that quantum\nenhancement can directly improve the scaling of classical optimization\nalgorithms for the paradigmatic LABS problem."}

Here we propose a natural and\nefficient basis for electron nuclear dynamics by drawing on the concepts of\npointer and preferred states from decoherence theory, adapted to systems where\nelectrons and nuclei interact strongly. Within this framework, we show that 1)\nthe independent dynamics exploited by mixed quantum classical (MQC) methods is\nbest understood as a manifestation of entanglement viewed in a preferred basis,\nrather than a consequence of decoherence, and 2) the adiabatic Born Oppenheimer\nstates satisfy the conditions of an approximate preferred basis. This\nperspective reconciles widely used approximations with a more fundamental\nstructure of the theory and provides a systematic route to more reliable MQC\nstrategies. In effect, we revisit MQC methods through the lens of preferred\nstates, clarifying when they succeed and how they can be improved."}
