For reliable quantum\ncomputing, it is important how long a qubit can remain in a superposition of\nquantum states, which is determined by the coherence time (T1). The coherence\ntime of a qubit effectively sets the \"lifetime\" of usable quantum information,\ndetermining how long quantum computations can be performed before errors occur\nand information is lost. There are several sources of decoherence in transmon\nqubits, but the predominant one is generally considered to be dielectric losses\nin the natural oxide layer formed on the surface of the superconductor. In this\npaper, we present a numerical study of microwave surface losses in planar\nsuperconducting antennas of different transmon qubit designs. An asymptotic\nmethod for estimating the energy participation ratio in ultrathin films of\nnanometer scales is proposed, and estimates are given for the limits of\nachievable minimum RF losses depending on the electrical properties of the\nsurface oxide and the interface of the qubit with the substrate material."}

By exploiting graph-based machine learning, our approach avoids\nextracting the circuit features for the model evaluation but directly embeds it\nas a graph, significantly accelerating the optimal target decision-making\nprocess and maintaining all the information. Experimental results prove 94.4%\naccuracy and an 85.5% F1 score for the minority class, effectively predicting\nthe best compilation target.

In this work, we investigate AQIM from multiple\nperspectives and propose using random isometries to construct approximate\nmaskers. First, different notions of AQIM are introduced and we find there are\nprofound intrinsic connections among them. These relationships are\ncharacterized by a set of figures of merit, which are introduced to quantify\nthe deviation of AQIM from exact QIM. We then explore the possibility of\nrealizing AQIM via random isometries in bipartite and multipartite systems.

Poddubny"], "title": "Persistent subradiant correlations in a random driven Dicke model", "comment": "5 pages, 5 figures, 1 table + Supplemental Material 2 pages, 2\n  figures, 2 tables", "summary": "We study theoretically the driven-dissipative dynamics of an array of\ntwo-level emitters, coupled to a single photonic mode, in the presence of\ndisorder in the resonant frequencies. We introduce the notion of subradiant\ncorrelations in the dynamics, corresponding to the eigenstates of the\nLiouvillian with a low decay rate, that can also oscillate in time. While the\nusual collective subradiant states do not survive the emitter resonant\nfrequency fluctuations, these subradiant correlations are immune to such a type\nof disorder. These long-living correlations exist in finite-size systems, when\ntheir lifetime is parametrically longer than in the so-called Dicke time\ncrystal phase."}
