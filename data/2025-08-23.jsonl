In addition, we can\nidentify three distinct depth-dependent regimes, each signaled by a different\nscaling of cross-entropy benchmarking (XEB) fidelity over time. In the\nshallow-depth regime, noise effects are perturbatively small; in the\nintermediate regime, circuit-induced fluctuations and noise compete on equal\nfooting; and in the deep-depth regime, the output distribution becomes\neffectively classical, up to corrections that are exponentially small in the\nnoise strength. We provide quantitative predictions for the anticoncentration\nof generic circuits at finite depth, which we benchmark with numerical\nsimulations giving perfect agreement even for shallow circuits.

We present a quantum numerical scheme based on\nthree steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant\nobservables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite\ndifference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula\napproximations, also known as Trotterization. Novel numerical analysis is\nintroduced to bound the different sources of error and we prove that, for the\nproduct formula approximations, vector norm analysis guarantees similar\naccuracy with exponentially fewer time steps than operator-norm-based\napproaches, thereby significantly reducing the projected computational\nresources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations\nthat confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling.

However, there\nare states termed as absolutely separable, from which entanglement cannot be\ncreated through any non-local unitary action. Thus, from a resource-theoretic\nperspective, non-absolutely separable states are useful as they can be turned\ninto entangled states using some appropriate unitary gates. In this work, we\npropose an efficient method to detect non-absolutely separable states. Our\napproach relies on evaluating moments that can bypass the need for full state\ntomography, thereby enhancing its practical applicability. We then present\nseveral examples in support of our detection scheme. We also address a closely\nrelated problem concerning states whose partial transpose remains positive\nunder any arbitrary non-local unitary action. Furthermore, we examine the\neffectiveness of our moment-based approach in the detection of quantum channels\nthat are not absolutely separating, which entails the detection of resource\npreserving channels. Finally, we demonstrate the operational significance of\nnon-absolutely separable states by proving that every such state can provide an\nadvantage in a quantum-channel discrimination task."}

This paper introduces vibe decoding which, for the\nfirst time, brings colour code performance on par with the surface code under\npractical decoding. Our approach leverages an ensemble of belief propagation\ndecoders - each executing a distinct serial message passing schedule - combined\nwith localised statistics post-processing.
