They are appealing for the experimental\nease with which they can be produced, and for their compact and an elegant\nmathematical description. Nevertheless, many proposed quantum technologies\nrequire us to go beyond the realm of Gaussian states and introduce non-Gaussian\nelements. In terms of quantum resource theory, we can then recognize\nnon-Gaussian states as resources and Gaussian operations and states as free,\nwhich can be used and prepared easily. Given such a structure of resource\ntheory, the task of broadcasting the resource is to determine if the resource\ncontent of a state can be cloned in a meaningful way, which, if possible,\nprovides a strong operation for manipulation of the resource. In this work, we\nprove that broadcasting of non-Gaussian states via Gaussian operations is not\npossible. For this, we first show that the relative entropy of non- Gaussianity\nis not super-additive, which rules it out as a prime candidate in the analysis\nof such no-go results. Our proof is then based on understanding fixed points of\nGaussian operations and relates to the theory of control systems. The no-go\ntheorem also states that if two initially uncorrelated systems interact by\nGaussian dynamics and non-Gaussianity is created at one subsystem, then the\nnon-Gaussianity of the other subsystem must be reduced. Further, keeping the\nset of free operations fixed to Gaussian operations, we can also comment on the\nbroadcasting of Wigner negativity and genuine quantum non-Gaussianity."}

However, transferring concepts and methods between\nsuch fundamentally different platforms entails both practical and theoretical\nchallenges. The formalisms of these two \"universes\" differ significantly, and\nmany notions, although sharing the same names, possess distinct properties and\nphysical interpretations. In this work, we construct a bridge between DV and CV\nsystems by means of the tomographic probability representation of quantum\nstates complemented by the Jordan-Schwinger map. We connect observable random\nvariables such as spin projections, photon numbers, or quadratures arising in\nDV and CV architectures through their probabilistic representations, namely\nspin, photon-number, and symplectic tomograms, as well as the Wigner function.\nThis makes it possible to directly obtain the tomogram in one architecture from\nmeasurement data in another, thereby reconstructing the corresponding state\nacross representations realizing similar statistics. The proposed formalism\nenables a unified framework for comparing and transferring quantum information\nacross different hardware platforms. This facilitates the design of hybrid\nprotocols where, for example, spin-based quantum memories interface with\nphotonic communication channels or CV bosonic codes. It also provides a\npractical tool for benchmarking quantum devices, validating algorithms across\nheterogeneous architectures, and exploring error correction schemes that rely\non mappings between finite- and infinite-dimensional systems."}

In this work,\nwe emulate a passive \\PT~dimer using a two-mode, non-Hermitian system of\nsuperconducting qubits comprising one high-coherence qubit coupled to an\nintentionally lossy qubit via a tunable coupler. The loss is introduced by\nstrongly coupling the qubit to a continuum of photonic modes in an open\nwaveguide environment.

By considering a class of models based upon\nquantum continuous variables, here we show how the maximum extractable energy\nfrom a bosonic quantum battery can be intimately related to Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle. We found that realizing minimum uncertainty essentially\nguarantees that all of the energy stored in a Gaussian quantum battery can be\nwithdrawn and used to do work. For a standard system where the charger and\nbattery are coupled linearly, this criterion is satisfied rather trivially.\nHowever, our theoretical results demonstrate that - for a quantum battery with\nnonlinear coupling - a state of minimum uncertainty can also be achieved\nnontrivially via the generation of quantum squeezing.
