Placing these qubits at surfaces maximizes coupling to nearby spins and fields, enabling nanoscale sensing and facilitating integration with photonic and superconducting devices. However, reducing the dimensions or size of established qubit systems without sacrificing the qubit performance or degrading the coherence lifetime remains challenging. Here, we introduce a surface molecular qubit formed by pentacene molecules scaffolded on a two-dimensional (2D) material, hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The qubit exhibits stable fluorescence and optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) from cryogenic to ambient conditions. With fully deuterated pentacene, the Hahn-echo coherence reaches 22 $μ$s and further extends to 214 $μ$s under dynamical decoupling, outperforming state-of-the-art shallow NV centers in diamond, despite being positioned directly on the surface. We map the local spin environment, resolving couplings to nearby nuclear and electron spins that can serve as auxiliary quantum resources. This platform combines true surface integration, long qubit coherence, and scalable fabrication, opening routes to quantum sensing, quantum simulation, and hybrid quantum devices. It also paves the way for a broader family of 2D material-supported molecular qubits."}

Diamond is an especially attractive material for quantum devices because it can host atomic-scale defects that emit single photons and store quantum information with exceptional stability. However, fabricating the optical structures needed to control light in diamond typically relies on slow, bespoke processes that are difficult to scale. In this work, we introduce a manufacturing approach that brings diamond quantum photonics closer to industrial production. Instead of sequentially defining each device by lithography written directly on diamond, we fabricate high-precision silicon masks using commercial semiconductor foundries and transfer them onto diamond via microtransfer printing. These masks define large arrays of nanoscale optical structures, shifting the most demanding pattern-definition steps away from the diamond substrate, improving uniformity, yield, and throughput. Using this method, we demonstrate hundreds of diamond \"quantum microchiplets\" with improved optical performance and controlled interaction with quantum emitters. The chiplet format allows defective devices to be replaced and enables integration with existing photonic and electronic circuits. Our results show that high-quality diamond quantum devices can be produced using scalable, foundry-compatible techniques. This approach provides a practical pathway toward large-scale quantum photonic systems and hybrid quantum-classical technologies built on established semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure."}

Multi-angle QAOA (MA-QAOA), which assigns independent parameters to each Hamiltonian operator term, achieves superior approximation performance even with fewer layers than standard QAOA. Unfortunately, this increased expressibility can raise the classical computational cost due to a greater number of parameters. The recently proposed Layerwise MA-QAOA (LMA-QAOA) reduces this overhead by training one layer at a time, but it may suffer from obtaining the precise solution due to the previously fixed parameters. This work addresses two questions for efficient MA-QAOA training: (i) What is the optimal granularity for parameter updates per epoch, and (ii) How can we get precise final cost function results while only partially updating the parameters per epoch? Despite the benefit of reducing the parameters that update per epoch can reduce the classical computation overhead, too fine or coarse a granularity of Hamiltonian update can degrade the MA-QAOA training efficiency. We find that optimizing one complete layer per epoch is an efficient granularity. Moreover, selectively retraining each layer by tracking gradient variations can achieve a final cost function equivalent to the standard MA-QAOA while lowering the parameter update overhead. Based on these insights, we propose Orbit-QAOA, which cyclically revisits layers and selectively freezes stabilized parameters. Across diverse graph benchmarks, Orbit-QAOA reduces training steps by up to 81.8%, reduces approximation ratio error by up to 72x compared to the unified stop condition-applied enhanced LMA-QAOA, and achieves equivalent approximation performance compared to the standard MA-QAOA."}

Using the Redheffer star product to construct global scattering matrices from local ones, we identify resonant concatenation, a nonlinear composition rule generated by internal back-reflections. In contrast to ordinary channel concatenation, resonant concatenation can suppress noise and even produce super-activation of the quantum capacity, yielding positive capacity in configurations where each constituent channel individually has zero capacity. We illustrate these effects through models exhibiting resonant-tunneling-enhanced transport. Our approach provides a general methodology for analyzing coherent information flow in quantum graphs, with relevance for quantum communication, control, and simulation in structured environments."}

We introduce a noise-resilient framework for Quantum Signal Processing (QSP) that mitigates such coherent errors without increasing circuit depth or ancillary qubit requirements. Our approach uses ensembles of noisy QSP circuits combined with measurement-level averaging to suppress random phase errors in Z rotations. Building on this framework, we develop robust QSP algorithms for implementing polynomial functions of Hermitian matrices and for estimating observables, with applications to Hamiltonian simulation, quantum linear systems, and ground-state preparation. We analyze the trade-off between approximation error and hardware noise, which is essential for practical implementation under the stringent depth and coherence constraints of current quantum hardware.

We extend this result to infinite dimensions with a simpler proof. For states on $\\mathbb{C}^{d_A \\times d_A} \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{d_B \\times d_B}$, we strengthen this existence result by constructing an $O(d_A^2 d_B^2)$-time algorithm that specifies such a perfect one-way LOCC protocol.

At the core of all of these results is the fact that every operator with vanishing trace admits a basis where its diagonal entries are all zero."}

For instance, the work we need to invest in order to implement $n$ independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) copies of a quantum channel is quantified by the thermodynamic capacity of the channel when we require the implementation's accuracy to be guaranteed in diamond norm over the $n$-system input. Recent work showed that work extraction can be implemented universally, meaning the same implementation works for a large class of input states, while achieving a variable work cost that is optimal for each individual i.i.d. input state. Here, we revisit some techniques leading to derivation of the thermodynamic capacity, and leverage them to construct a thermodynamic implementation of $n$ i.i.d. copies of any time-covariant quantum channel, up to some process decoherence that is necessary because the implementation reveals the amount of consumed work. The protocol uses so-called thermal operations and achieves the optimal per-input work cost for any i.i.d. input state; it relies on the conditional erasure protocol in our earlier work, adjusted to yield variable work. We discuss the effect of the work-cost decoherence. While it can significantly corrupt the correlations between the output state and any reference system, we show that for any time-covariant i.i.d. input state, the state on the output system faithfully reproduces that of the desired process to be implemented. As an immediate consequence of our results, we recover recent results for optimal work extraction from i.i.d. states up to the error scaling and implementation specifics, and propose an optimal preparation protocol for time-covariant i.i.d. states."}

We reconsider contextuality from an information-theoretic perspective, focusing on operational models constrained to maintain a single internal state with fixed semantics across multiple contexts. Under this constraint, we show that contextual statistics certify an unavoidable obstruction to classical probabilistic descriptions. Specifically, any classical model that reproduces such statistics must either embed contextual dependence into the internal state or introduce additional external labels carrying nonzero information. This result identifies contextuality as a witness of irreducible information cost in classical representations, rather than as a purely nonclassical anomaly. From this viewpoint, quantum probability emerges as a canonical framework that accommodates contextual operations without requiring explicit contextual encoding."}

Consequently, a sufficient condition for realizing a continuous time crystal is a nonlinear quantum self-sustaining system exhibiting quantum synchronization among its constituents. As a concrete example, we demonstrate spontaneous oscillations in a synchronized array of van der Pol oscillators, corroborated by both semiclassical dynamics and the quantum Liouville spectrum.

The Frequency mixing scheme developed here enables continuous tunablity of the resonant frequency between upper levels, which facilitates the broad band sensing of AC field. Furthermore, by introducing an additional periodic driving, we realize an effective model that two distinct quantum interference effects coexist: interference among Floquet channels and loop interference arising from closed coherent pathways. Both interference effects could be read out from the transmission spectra independently. The changing of the distance between double splitting peaks represents the interference of Floquet channels, while their asymmetric linewidth broadening is linked with the total effective phase of the loop.

Network nonlocality sharing is witnessed when the quantum values of the network correlations associated with relevant parties simultaneously violate a star-network Bell inequality generated from the given class of bipartite Bell inequalities. We streamline the calculation of the quantum values of the network correlations and derive an analytical expression for the bipartite quantum correlator, valid for arbitrary measurement settings and weak-measurement strengths. The network nonlocality sharing for Vértesi inequalities has been studied within the framework, and simultaneous violations are found in $(2,2,6)$ and $(2,2,465)$ cases, with the latter exhibiting greater robustness. Our approach suggests a practical route to studying network nonlocality sharing by utilizing diverse bipartite Bell inequalities beyond the commonly used CHSH-type constructions."}

Superconducting quantum processors have demonstrated high-fidelity operations, but on larger devices there is commonly a broad distribution of qualities, with the low-performing tail affecting near-term performance and applications. Here we present an error budgeting procedure for the native two-qubit operation on a 32-qubit superconducting-qubit-based quantum computer, the OQC Toshiko gen-1 system. We estimate the prevalence of different forms of error such as coherent error and control qubit leakage, then apply error suppression strategies based on the most significant sources of error, making use of pulse-shaping and additional compensating gates. These techniques require no additional hardware overhead and little additional calibration, making them suitable for routine adoption. An average reduction of 3.7x in error rate for two qubit operations is shown across a chain of 16 qubits, with the median error rate improving from 4.6$\\%$ to 1.2$\\%$ as measured by interleaved randomized benchmarking. The largest improvements are seen on previously under-performing qubit pairs, demonstrating the importance of practical error suppression in reducing the low-performing tail of gate qualities and achieving consistently good performance across a device."}

In contrast to the preceding investigations, the quantum phase transition between localized state and extended one is achieved by adjusting the strength of intracellular or intercellular hopping. The energy spectra and eigenstate distributions of the system's Hamiltonian near the boundary of the phase transition exhibit different behaviors when the Hermiticity, non-Hermiticity and mosaic modulation of the quasi-periodic potential are considered, respectively. The existence of the mobility ring is revealed in the non-Hermitian SSH chain by studying of the critical behaviors near the boundary. More interestingly, the multiple mobility rings emerge when the period number of the mosaic modulation is increased. The result is helpful for the investigation of the localization-delocalization transition in the SSH-type system under the combined action of the non-Hermiticity and quasi-periodicity."}

This approach differs significantly from other ontological interpretations such as Bohmian mechanics, spontaneous collapse, or many-worlds, and highlights the major role of contextual quantization in shaping quantum theory."}

Accepting that quantum mechanics is valid all the way implies that not only composite particles (such as protons and neutrons) would be derived from a field theory, but also the center of mass of bodies as heavy as rocks. Despite the fabulous success of quantum mechanics, it is unreasonable to assume the existence of annihilation and creation operators for rocks, and so on. Fortunately, there are strong reasons to doubt that wave mechanics can describe the center of mass of systems at or above the Planck scale, thereby jeopardizing the construction of the corresponding Fock space. As a result, systems with masses exceeding the Planck mass would have their center of mass described through classical mechanics, regardless of being able to harbor macroscopic quantum phenomena as observed in the laboratory. Here, we briefly revisit (i) the arguments for the need for a Heisenberg cut delimitating the boundary between the quantum and classical realms and (ii) the kind of new physics expected at (the uncharted region of) the Heisenberg cut.''"}

For an unstructured search, Grover's algorithm predicts a quadratic speedup, with the search time $τ(N)=Θ(\\sqrt{N})$ and $N$ the database size. Numerical studies suggest that the time complexity can change in the presence of feedback, injecting information during the search. Here, we determine the time complexity of the quantum analog of a randomized algorithm, which implements feedback in a simple form. The search is a continuous-time quantum walk on a complete graph, where the target is continuously monitored by a detector. Additionally, the quantum state is reset if the detector does not click within a specified time interval. This yields a non-unitary, non-Markovian dynamics. We optimize the search time as a function of the hopping amplitude, detection rate, and resetting rate, and identify the conditions under which time complexity could outperform Grover's scaling. The overall search time does not violate Grover's optimality bound when including the time budget of the physical implementation of the measurement. For databases of finite sizes monitoring can warrant rapid convergence and provides a promising avenue for fault-tolerant quantum searches."}

We present a simulation-based study of temperature-dependent spectral dynamics and optical coherence in a mechanically decoupled quantum emitter in hBN. Employing a hybrid stochastic framework that combines Ornstein--Uhlenbeck detuning fluctuations with temperature-dependent, Gaussian-distributed discrete frequency jumps, motivated by experimentally observed spectral diffusion and blinking, we reproduce the measured evolution of inhomogeneous linewidth broadening and the progressive degradation of photon coherence across the relevant cryogenic range (5-30K). The model captures phonon-related spectral diffusion with a cubic temperature dependence and the onset of jump-like spectral instabilities at higher temperatures. By calibrating the hybrid diffusion, jump parameters to the experimentally measured full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the emission line and analyzing the second-order correlation function $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving, we establish a unified phenomenological description that links stochastic detuning dynamics to the decay of optical coherence in a resonantly driven emitter. Analysis of $g^{(2)}(τ)$ under resonant driving reveals an additional dephasing rate $γ_{\\mathrm{sd+j}}$ that rises monotonically with temperature and drive strength, leading to a predicted critical crossover to overdamped dynamics at $T_{\\mathrm{crit}} \\approx 25.91$~K. This hybrid framework provides a quantitative connection between accessible spectroscopic observables and the dominant noise mechanisms limiting coherent optical control in mechanically decoupled quantum emitters, exemplified in hBN and generalizable to similar emitters in other materials."}

In this paper, we introduce a post-selected quantum metrology scenario where the initial state, the dynamics associated with the phase shift, and the post-selection are all inspired by the Hardy paradox. Specifically, we identify an anomalous weak value that is characteristic of both the Hardy paradox and the potential enhancement of sensitivity by the post-selection. We find that the efficiency of the enhancement is reduced when the expectation value associated with the anomalous weak value is different from the inverse of this value. We conclude that the relation between enhanced phase estimation and the Hardy paradox requires a detailed understanding of the relation between weak values and expectation values."}

Starting from the quantisation of the electromagnetic field and the bosonic formalism of Fock space, the notes develop a unified framework for describing and analysing quantum states of light. Key families of states -- thermal, coherent, and squeezed -- are introduced as paradigmatic examples illustrating the transition from classical to nonclassical behaviour. The concepts of convexity, classicality, and quasiprobability representations are presented as complementary tools for characterising quantumness and defining operational notions such as P-nonclassicality. The discussion extends naturally to Gaussian states, composite systems, and continuous-variable entanglement, highlighting how nonclassicality serves as a resource for generating and quantifying quantum correlations. Theoretical developments are complemented by computational and experimental perspectives, including simulations of optical states using the Python library Strawberry Fields and data analysis from simulated data. Together, these notes aim to bridge the foundational concepts of quantum optics and modern quantum information, offering both conceptual insight and practical tools for students and researchers entering the field."}

We demonstrate that non-classical correlations of entangled photon pairs can be used to prepare narrowband two-exciton population distributions, circumventing transport in mediating states. The distributions thus created can be monitored using time-frequency-filtered photon coincidence counting, and the pathways contributing to photon emission events can be classified by tuning filtering parameters. Numerical simulations for a light-harvesting aggregate highlight the ability of this protocol to achieve selectivity by suppressing or amplifying specific pathways. Combining entangled photonic sources and multidimensional photon counting allow promising applications to spectroscopy and sensing."}

Working first in the ghostly two-dimensional Hamiltonian formulation, we construct differential intertwiners that generate a spectrum-generating algebra acting on the generalised eigenspaces of the Hamiltonian. This algebra organises the generalised eigenvectors into finite Jordan chains and closes into a hidden $su(2)$ Lie algebra that exists only at resonance.\n  We then show that quantising a classically equivalent Hamiltonian yields a radically different quantum theory, with a fully diagonalisable spectrum and genuine degeneracies.

In this work, we investigate the role of mixed-precision arithmetic in neural-network based Variational Monte Carlo (VMC), a widely used method for solving computationally otherwise intractable quantum many-body systems. We first derive general analytical bounds on the error introduced by reduced precision on Metropolis-Hastings MCMC, and then empirically validate these bounds on the use-case of VMC. We demonstrate that significant portions of the algorithm, in particular, sampling the quantum state, can be executed in half precision without loss of accuracy. More broadly, this work provides a theoretical framework to assess the applicability of mixed-precision arithmetic in machine-learning approaches that rely on MCMC sampling.

For the free particle, quantum fluctuations induce measurable phase shifts in azimuthal precession of approximately 8-12%, with uncertainty growth rates proportional to initial moment correlations. When a non-central Makarov potential is introduced, quantum corrections dramatically amplify its asymmetry. For strong coupling ($γ$ = -1.9), the quantum-corrected force drives trajectories preferentially toward the southern hemisphere on timescales 40% shorter than classical predictions, with trajectory densities exhibiting up to 3-fold enhancement in the preferred region. Throughout evolution, the solutions rigorously satisfy Heisenberg uncertainty relations, validating the truncation scheme.

This approach enforces all physical constraints exactly, yielding a globally unconstrained variational formulation of the bosonic ground-state problem. The unconstrained structure also naturally supports solution reuse across nearby Hamiltonians: warm-starting from previously optimized covariance matrices substantially reduces the number of optimization steps required for convergence in families of related configurations, as encountered in crystal lattices, molecular systems, and fluids.
