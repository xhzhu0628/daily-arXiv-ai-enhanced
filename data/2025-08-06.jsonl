Here we explore how physical catalysis can\nregulate the maximum extractable work (ergotropy) of a spin-chain QB strongly\ncoupled to a cavity environment. We model the system using a\nNakajima-Zwanzig-type non-Markovian master equation and simulate the time\nevolution of ergotropy under various physical parameters. Our results show that\nincreasing the catalyst-spin coupling, spin energy or cavity frequency can\neffectively suppress ergotropy oscillations and yield quasi-stationary\nergotropy regime, while overly strong catalyst, especially when accompanied by\nincreasing system-environment coupling under such conditions, can destabilize\nwork extraction. This study demonstrates how quantum catalysis can serve as a\ncontrol knob for optimizing battery performance in strongly coupled\nnon-Markovian regimes."}

Each of\nthese protocols involves square pulses with two driving frequencies which are\ninteger multiples of each other. For the first class of protocols, the duration\nof the pulse is changed randomly by an amplitude $dT$ while for the second\nclass we use a random/quasiperiodic dipolar drive, where the quasiperiodicity\nis implemented using the Thue-Morse (TM) or Fibonacci sequences. For both\nprotocols, we identify parameter regimes for which the thermalization of the\ndriven chain is drastically slowed down due to proximity to a two-rate drive\ninduced exact dynamical freezing. We also study the properties of these driven\nsystem moving slightly away from the freezing limit. For the first type of\nprotocols, we show the existence of special value of $dT$ for which the\nthermalization rate remains small and provide an analytic explanation for such\nslow thermalization. For the second class of protocols, in contrast to\nrandom/quasiperiodic drives involving a single frequency studied earlier, we\nfind that the TM quasiperiodic drive leads to a distinctly slower\nthermalization than that for drive protocols which are either periodic or\nfollow a random or quasiperiodic Fibonacci sequence. We provide a qualitative\nsemi-analytic understanding of these phenomena either using an exact\ncalculation for small system sizes or carrying out a perturbative analysis in\nthe large drive-amplitude limit. Our analysis brings out the central role of\nsuch two-frequency protocols in the reduction of heating in driven quantum\nsystems. We discuss experiments which can test our theory."}

One key ingredient of such\nimprovement is the introduction of tunable couplers to control the\nqubit-to-qubit coupling through frequency tuning. Moving toward fault-tolerant\nquantum computation, increasing the number of physical qubits is another step\ntoward effective error correction codes. Under a multiqubit architecture, flux\ncontrol (Z) lines are crucial in tuning the frequency of the qubits and\ncouplers. However, dense flux lines result in magnetic flux crosstalk, wherein\nmagnetic flux applied to one element inadvertently affects neighboring qubits\nor couplers. This crosstalk obscures the idle frequency of the qubit when flux\nbias is applied, which degrades gate performance and calibration accuracy. In\nthis study, we characterize flux crosstalk and suppress it in a\nmultiqubit-coupler chip with multi-Z lines without adding additional readout\nfor couplers. By quantifying the mutual flux-induced frequency shifts of qubits\nand couplers, we construct a cancellation matrix that enables precise\ncompensation of non-local flux, demonstrating a substantial reduction in Z-line\ncrosstalk from 56.5$\\,$permille$\\,$to 0.13$\\,$permille$\\,$ which is close to\nstatistical error. Flux compensation corrects the CZ SWAP measurement, leading\nto a symmetric map with respect to flux bias. Compared with a crosstalk-free\ncalculated CZ SWAP map, the measured map indicates that our approach provides a\nnear-zero crosstalk for the coupler-transmon system. These results highlight\nthe effectiveness of our approach in enhancing flux crosstalk-free control and\nsupporting its potential for scaling superconducting quantum processors."}

It is particularly relevant in drug development, vaccine\ndesign, and other biomedical applications. Over the years, various methods have\nbeen developed to estimate protein binding energy, ranging from experimental\ntechniques to computational approaches, with machine learning making\nsignificant contributions to this field. Although classical computing has\ndemonstrated strong results in constructing predictive models, the variation of\nquantum computing for machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative.\nQuantum neural networks (QNNs) have gained traction as a research focus,\nraising the question of their potential advantages in predicting binding\nenergies. To investigate this potential, this study explored the feasibility of\nQNNs for this task by proposing thirty variations of multilayer\nperceptron-based quantum neural networks. These variations span three distinct\narchitectures, each incorporating ten different quantum circuits to configure\ntheir quantum layers. The performance of these quantum models was compared with\nthat of a state-of-the-art classical multilayer perceptron-based artificial\nneural network, evaluating both accuracy and training time. A primary dataset\nwas used for training, while two additional datasets containing entirely unseen\nsamples were employed for testing. Results indicate that the quantum models\nachieved approximately 20% higher accuracy on one unseen dataset, although\ntheir accuracy was lower on the other datasets. Notably, quantum models\nexhibited training times several orders of magnitude shorter than their\nclassical counterparts, highlighting their potential for efficient protein\nbinding energy prediction."}

For this purpose, one can assume the quantum\ndescription of devices and use available information to strengthen the bound\nfor separable states, which may go beyond the local bound, enabling more\nefficient entanglement detection. Here we present a systematic approach for\nstrengthening Bell inequalities for qubit systems, using Mermin-Klyshko-Bell\ninequalities as examples, by considering measurement devices that are coarsely\ncalibrated only by their ability to generate nonlocal correlations without\nrequiring precise quantum characterization. In the case of bipartite and\ntripartite systems, we derive trade-offs between upper bounds for separable\nstates and general states in terms of structure functions to optimize the\nentanglement detection. We then strengthen n-partite Bell inequalities for the\ndetection of states exhibiting a diversity of entanglement structures such as\ngenuine multipartite entanglement. For general Bell scenarios with some\nmeasurements characterized, we demonstrate that entanglement can also be\ndetected with some local correlations by exploiting the\nNavascu\\'es-Pironio-Ac\\'in hierarchy of tests."}

We study SRE in\ntranslation-invariant matrix product states (MPS), deriving exact expressions\nfor representative states and introducing a numerically stable algorithm, named\nbond-DMRG, to compute the SRE density in infinite systems. Applying this\nmethod, we obtain high-precision SRE densities for the ground state of the\none-dimensional Ising model. We also analyze non-local SRE density, showing it\nis bounded by a universal function of entanglement entropy, and further prove\nthat two-site mutual SRE vanishes asymptotically in injective MPS.
