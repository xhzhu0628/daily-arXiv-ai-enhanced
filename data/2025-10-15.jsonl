Due to\ndecoherence, the quality of the computational outcome can degrade seriously\nwith increasing circuit length. Thus, there is major interest to reduce a\nquantum circuit to an equivalent circuit which is in its gate count as short as\npossible. One method to address efficient transpilation is based on approaches\nknown from stochastic optimization, e.g. by using random sampling and token\nreplacement strategies. Here, a core challenge is that these methods can suffer\nfrom sampling efficiency, causing long and energy consuming optimization time.\nAs a remedy, we propose in this work 2D neural guided sampling. Thus, given a\n2D representation of a quantum circuit, a neural network predicts groups of\ngates in the quantum circuit, which are likely reducible. Thus, it leads to a\nsampling prior which can heavily reduce the compute time for quantum circuit\nreduction.
