Using the QEC simulation package STIM, repetition code\ncircuits on rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from\ndistances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect\nlocations. In addition, we simulated heterogeneous noise models using the same\nparameters to test how increasingly deviated distributions of physical errors\nscale across code distances under realistic, heterogeneous noise models that\nare informed by current superconducting hardware.
