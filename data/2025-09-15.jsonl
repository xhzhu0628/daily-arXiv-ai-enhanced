One approach to\ndeal with this problem is to use the density matrix within the\nLiouville-von-Neumann formalism or the Markovian variant the Lindblad\nequations. Another way is to use a stochastic approach where a random force is\nadded to the system. The benefit of the stochastic approach is to solve the\ndynamics of the system with less time and memory than the density matrix\napproaches. In this project we want to develop a stochastic approach that can\ndeal with the stochastic wave functions approach. We did this on a 2-level\nsystem and found that it works well when comparing to a density matrix\napproach. Next, we tested a quantum particle connect to a bath of harmonic\noscillators using the stochastic approach. We found that a friction term is\nnecessary and applied it. Like in the classical Langevin equations the friction\nconstant and the random force fluctuations are related by the\nfluctuation-dissipation constant. We showed that with friction the dynamics\ndecays to an ensemble with energy of $E_{gs}+k_BT$. However, we also found here\nare problems. The system seems to absorb energy indefinitely if the temperature\nis higher than the zero point energy or if the system is a Morse oscillator.\nThus more research is required to make this method work."}

Both one-vs-rest and two-step hierarchical\nclassification schemes were implemented. The QSVM involves angle encoding of\nten features, two unitary operator blocks consisting of rotational operator\ngates, and a projective measurement that projects the final state to the zero\nstate. The HHL-based method involves solving a system of linear equations using\nthe HHL algorithm and using the solution in a support vector machine approach.\nThe results indicate that the QSVM outperforms HHL LS-SVM in most cases. HHL\nLS-SVM performs somewhat competitively in selected cases, particularly when\nisolating galaxies (majority), however, it also performs poorly in others,\nespecially when isolating QSOs (minority). Comparisons with classical SVMs\nconfirm that quantum and classical methods achieve broadly similar performance,\nwith classical models performing slightly ahead overall. Scaling analysis\nreveals a trade-off: QSVM performance suffers from quadratic scaling with the\nnumber of samples and features, but benefits from explicit feature\nrepresentation during training, while HHL LS-SVM scales essentially constantly,\nwith moderate fluctuations, but suffers from limited representative elements.\nThe HHL-based method is also highly noise-sensitive. These results suggest that\nQSVM performs better overall and will perform better on current hardware as\nwell, but that the more efficient scaling of HHL LS-SVM makes it a useful\noption for larger datasets with many samples, especially if we move past the\nNISQ era."}

Despite rapid advances in QKD,\nconventional protocols still employ beam splitters (BSs) for passive random\nbasis selection. However, BSs intrinsically suffer from photon loss, imperfect\nsplitting ratios, and polarization dependence, limiting the key rate,\nincreasing the quantum bit error rate (QBER), and constraining scalability,\nparticularly over long distances. By contrast, EPSs based on spontaneous\nparametric down-conversion (SPDC) intrinsically exhibit quantum randomness in\nspatial and spectral degrees of freedom, offering a natural replacement for BSs\nin basis selection. Here, we demonstrate a proof-of-concept\nspatial-randomness-based QKD scheme in which the annular SPDC emission ring is\ndivided into four sections, effectively generating two independent EPSs. pair\nphotons from these sources, distributed to Alice and Bob, enable H/V and D/A\nmeasurements. The quantum-random pair generation inherently mimics the\nstochastic basis choice otherwise performed by a BS. Experimentally, our scheme\nachieves a 6.4-fold enhancement in sifted key rate, a consistently reduced\nQBER, and a near-ideal encoding balance between logical bits 0 and 1.\nFurthermore, the need for four spatial channels can be avoided by employing\nwavelength demultiplexing to generate two EPSs at distinct wavelength pairs.\nHarnessing intrinsic spatial/spectral randomness thus enables robust,\nbias-free, high-rate, and low-QBER QKD, offering a scalable pathway for\nnext-generation quantum networks."}
