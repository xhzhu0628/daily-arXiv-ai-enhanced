Realising this potential necessitates the efficient encoding and processing of financial data on quantum computers. In this study, we propose using the GASP (Genetic Algorithm for State Preparation) framework to optimise the encoding of stock price data into quantum states and show it can enhance both the fidelity and efficiency of the encoding process. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by encoding stock price data onto both a simulated and real quantum computer to calculate the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) entropy. Our results show improvements in fidelity and the potential for more precise financial analysis. This research provides insights into the applicability of GASP for the efficient encoding of real-world data, specifically stock price data, which is crucial for quantum advantage on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era quantum computers."}

Quantum entanglement, through squeezed and GHZ states, enables sensing beyond classical limits. However, such a quantum advantage has so far been confined to two-mode bosonic systems, as analogous multi-mode squeezed states are non-trivial to prepare. Here, we develop a Monte-Carlo based optimization technique which can be used to efficiently engineer a Hamiltonian control-sequence for multi-mode bosonic systems to prepare multi-mode squeezed states. Specifically, we consider a Bose-Einstein condensate in an optical lattice, relevant for applications in gravimetry and gradiometry, and demonstrate that metrologically useful squeezed states can be generated using the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian which includes on-site atomic interactions, tunable via Feshbach resonances. By analyzing the distribution (density) of the quantum Fisher information (QFI) over the Hilbert space, we identify a characteristic \\textit{intermediate scaling} of the QFI: $\\mathcal{O}(N^2 L+L^2 N)$, which lies between the standard quantum limit (SQL) and the Heisenberg limit (HL) for $N$ atoms in $L$ modes. We show that in general, within the Hilbert space there is a finite, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ measure subset of Hilbert space with an intermediate QFI scaling. Therefore, one can find a Hamiltonian control sequence using a Monte Carlo optimization over random control sequences, that produces a state with intermediate scaling of the QFI. We assume an experimentally accessible range of the control parameters in the Hamiltonian resources and show that the intermediate scaling can be readily achieved. Our results indicate that the HL can be approached in quantum gravimetry using realistic experimental parameters for systems with $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and $N\\gg L$."}

This is borne out in the mathematics, where mixed state algorithms have always required more sophisticated techniques to design and analyze than pure state algorithms. We present a new approach to tomography demonstrating that, contrary to this belief, state-of-the-art mixed state tomography follows easily and naturally from pure state algorithms.\n  We analyze the following strategy: given $n$ copies of an unknown state $ρ$, convert them into copies of a purification $|ρ\\rangle$; run a pure state tomography algorithm to produce an estimate of $|ρ\\rangle$; and output the resulting estimate of $ρ$. The purification subroutine was recently discovered via the \"acorn trick\" of Tang, Wright, and Zhandry. With this strategy, we obtain the first tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal in all parameters. For a rank-$r$ $d$-dimensional state, it uses $n = O((rd + \\log(1/δ))/\\varepsilon)$ samples to output an estimate which is $\\varepsilon$-close in fidelity with probability at least $1-δ$. This algorithm also uses poly$(n)$ gates, making it the first gate-efficient tomography algorithm which is sample-optimal even in terms of the dimension $d$ alone. Moreover, with this method we recover essentially all results on mixed state tomography, including its applications to tomography with limited entanglement, classical shadows, and quantum metrology. Our proofs are simple, closing the gap in conceptual difficulty between mixed and pure tomography. Our results also clarify the role of entangled measurement in mixed state tomography: the only step of the algorithm which requires entanglement across copies is the purification step, suggesting that, for tomography, the reason entanglement is useful is for consistent purification."}

An electromagnetic resonator is used to probe the parity of the qubit-ensemble. The action of sequential measurements allows the nonclassicality of whole ensemble to manifest itself, in the ideal case, irrespective of its size. This enables to probe the macroscopic limits of quantum mechanics as the qubit-ensemble is, effectively, a single large spin of many $\\hbar$ units. Even as $\\hbar \\rightarrow 0$ in comparison to the total angular momentum of the ensemble, a constant amount of violation of MR is found in the noiseless case. However, environmental decoherence and inhomogeneity of qubit-electromagnetic field couplings precipitate the quantum-to-classical transition.

How to efficiently test their quantumness at these scales? We show that the violation of Macrorealism (MR), being the fact that classical systems possess definite properties that can be measured without disturbances, provide a fruitful avenue to this aim. The No Disturbance Condition (NDC) - the equality used here to test MR - can be violated by two consecutive parity measurements on $N$ qubits and found to be independent of $N$ under ideal conditions. However, realistic noisy QCs show a quantum-to-classical transition as $N$ increases, giving a foundationally-motivated scalable benchmarking metric. Two methods are formulated to implement this metric: one that involves a mid-circuit measurement, probing the irreversible collapse of the wavefunction, in contrast to the reversible entanglement generated in the other. Both methods are designed to be clumsiness-loophole free: the unwanted classical disturbances are negligible within statistical error. Violation of MR is detected on a IBM QC up to $N = 38$ qubits, increasing $N$ by one order of magnitude over best known results of MR. Two QCs are benchmarked using the proposed NDC metric, showing a three-fold improvement in their quantumness from one generation to the next."}

Each module or trap can perform only one operation at a time, resulting in low intra-trap parallelism, but there is no restriction on operations happening on independent traps, enabling high inter-trap parallelism. Unlike their superconducting counterparts, the design space for QCCDs is relatively flexible and can be explored beyond current grid designs. In particular, current grid-based architectures significantly limit the performance of many promising, high-rate codes such as HGP codes and BB codes, suffering from numerous trap to trap ``roadblocks\", forcing serialization and destroying the inherent parallelism of these codes.. Many of these codes are highly parallelizable, meaning that with appropriate hardware layouts and matching software schedules, execution latency can be reduced. Faster execution, in turn, reduces error accumulation from decoherence and heating, ultimately improving code performance when mapped to realistic hardware. To address this, we propose Cyclone, a circular software-hardware codesign that departs from traditional 2D grids in favor of a flexible ring topology, where ancilla qubits move in lockstep. Cyclone eliminates roadblocks, bounds total movement, and enables high levels of parallelism, resulting in up to ~4$\\times$ speedup in execution times. With HGP codes, Cyclone achieves up to a 2$\\times$ order of magnitude improvement in logical error rate, and with BB codes, this improvement reaches up to a 3$\\times$ in order of magnitude.Spatially, Cyclone reduces the number of required traps and ancilla qubits by $2\\times$.The overall spacetime improvement over a standard grid is up to $\\sim 20 \\times$, demonstrating Cyclone as a scalable and efficient alternative to conventional 2D QCCD architectures."}

The sensitivity of the quantum sensing depends on how precisely spin observables can be determined in the measurement, and is intrinsically limited by the uncertainties of the observables. The use of a spin-squeezed state in a quantum sensor can reduce the uncertainty below the standard quantum limit when combined with an appropriate measurement procedure. Here, we discuss the simulation study of the generation of a squeezed state in an interacting spin system. We show that a spin system coupled by the magnetic dipole interaction can create a squeezed state. Model systems to realize the spin squeezing experimentally are also discussed. In addition, we find that a squeezed state is a type of entangled state. The present work paves the way to realize a squeezed state using a spin system to build a quantum sensor network with improved sensitivity, and to use it for the detection of quantum entanglement."}

We develop a graph-theoretic framework for quantifying this resource for large families of binary measurements, including Pauli observables on multi-qubit systems and $k$-body Majorana observables on $n$-mode fermionic systems. To each set of observables we associate an anti-commutativity graph, whose vertices represent observables and whose edges indicate pairs that anti-commute. In this representation, the incompatibility robustness--the minimal amount of classical noise required to render the set jointly measurable--becomes a graph invariant. We derive general bounds on this invariant in terms of the Lovász number, clique number, and fractional chromatic number, and show that the Lovász number yields the correct asymptotic scaling for $k$-body Majorana observables. For line graphs $L(G)$, which naturally arise in the characterisation of exactly solvable spin models, we obtain spectral bounds on the robustness expressed through the energy and skew-energy of the underlying graph $G$. These bounds become tight for highly symmetric graphs, leading to closed formulas for several graph families. Finally, we identify structural conditions under which the robustness is determined by a simple function of the graph's maximum degree and the number of vertices and edges, and show that such extremal cases occur only when combinatorial structures such as Hadamard, conference or weighing matrices exist."}

In this context, it has recently been shown that the energy stored in free fermion quantum batteries is sensitive to the quantum phase diagram of the battery itself. This sensitivity is relevant for stabilizing the stored energy and designing optimal charging protocols. In this article, we explore universal charging behaviors of free fermion quantum batteries across quantum phase transitions. We first analyze a Dirac cone-like model to extract general features. Then, we verify our findings by means of two relevant lattice models, namely the Ising chain in a transverse field and the Haldane model."}

Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy of MAPbI3 embedded in nanoslot cavities reveals three polariton branches above the critical temperature Tc = 162.5 K, and the emergence of an additional branch below Tc, activated by a new phonon mode in the low-temperature phase. The full dispersion is accurately reproduced using a multimode Hopfield model, confirming that all normalized coupling strengths remain in the ultrastrong coupling regime.

We introduce Medusa, an automated compilation method for lowering a circuit's failure rate. Medusa uses flags to predict the absence of high-weight errors. Our method can numerically upper bound the failure rate of a circuit in the presence of flags, and fine tune the fault-tolerance of the flags in order to reach this bound. We assume the flags can have an increased fault-tolerance as a result of applying surface QECs to the gates interacting with them. We use circuit level depolarizing noise to evaluate the effectiveness of these flags in revealing the absence of the high-weight stabilizers. Medusa reduces the cost of quantum-error-correction (QEC) because the underlying circuit has a lower failure rate. We benchmark our approach using structured quantum circuits representative of ripple-carry adders. In particular, our flag scheme demonstrates that for adder-like circuits, the failure rate of large-scale implementations can be lowered to fit the failure rates of smaller-scale circuits. We show numerically that a slight improvement in the local fault-tolerance of the flag-qubits can lead to a reduction in the overall failure rate of the entire quantum circuit."}

By employing a specific set of non-commuting observables, we formulate an uncertainty-based criterion for identifying $W$ states and rigorously demonstrate its generality in distinguishing them from other tripartite entangled states, such as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state.

Today, the development of quantum computers threatens the security systems of classical cryptography. Moreover, as QKD networks are designed for protecting secret communication, they suffer from multiple operational difficulties: adaptive to dynamic conditions, optimization for multiple parameters and effective resource utilization. In order to overcome these obstacles, we propose a GNN-based framework which can model QKD networks as dynamic graphs and extracts exploitable characteristics from these networks' structure. The graph contains not only topological information but also specific characteristics associated with quantum communication (the number of edges between nodes, etc). Experimental results demonstrate that the GNN-optimized QKD network achieves a substantial increase in total key rate (from 27.1 Kbits/s to 470 Kbits/s), a reduced average QBER (from 6.6% to 6.0%), and maintains path integrity with a slight reduction in average transmission distance (from 7.13 km to 6.42 km). Furthermore, we analyze network performance across varying scales (10 to 250 nodes), showing improved link prediction accuracy and enhanced key generation rate in medium-sized networks. This work introduces a novel operation mode for QKD networks, shifting the paradigm of network optimization through adaptive and scalable quantum communication systems that enhance security and performance."}

This formula reproduces the depletion and saturation effects observed in previous studies of inhomogeneous free-fermion chains, and provides a theoretical framework to understand entanglement entropy suppression in these models. We demonstrate the accuracy of our asymptotic formula in several chains with different hopping and magnetic field profiles.

This version of the quantum speed limit can be shown to be directly relevant in weak measurements and quantum metrology.

Variational quantum algorithms have been proposed for solving problems in these domains. However, the design of the quantum circuit ansatz remains a challenge. Of particular interest is developing a method to generate circuits for any given instance of a problem, not merely a circuit tailored to a specific instance of the problem. To this end, we present a reinforcement learning (RL) approach to learning a problem-dependent quantum circuit mapping, which outputs a circuit for the ground state of a Hamiltonian from a given family of parameterized Hamiltonians. For quantum chemistry, our RL framework takes as input a molecule and a discrete set of bond distances, and it outputs a bond-distance-dependent quantum circuit for arbitrary bond distances along the potential energy curve. The inherently non-greedy approach of our RL method contrasts with existing greedy approaches to adaptive, problem-tailored circuit constructions. We demonstrate its effectiveness for the four-qubit and six-qubit lithium hydride molecules, as well as an eight-qubit H$_4$ chain. Our learned circuits are interpretable in a physically meaningful manner, thus paving the way for applying RL to the development of novel quantum circuits for the ground states of large-scale molecular systems."}

The formalism naturally separates geometric and dissipative contributions, identified by a Berry curvature and a metric in parameter space, respectively. Analytical results show that the geometric heat pumped per cycle is bounded by $k_B T N_q \\ln 2$ for $N_q$ non-interacting qubits, in direct analogy with the Landauer limit for entropy change. This bound can be surpassed when qubit interactions and asymmetric couplings to the baths are introduced.
