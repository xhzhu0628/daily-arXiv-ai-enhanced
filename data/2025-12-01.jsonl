Separate from other game-theoretic settings, parallel repetition for the Odd-Cycle game is related to the foam problem, which can be formulated through a minimization of the surface area. In comparison to previous works on minimizing the surface area, we quantify how properties of the marked giant connected component can be related to the maximum winning probability using Quantum strategies. Objects that we introduce to formulate such connections include the topological odd-blocker, previous examples of error bounds for other Quantum games that have been formulated by the author, pearls, consistent regions, and the cycle elimination problem."}

It was predicted some thirty years ago that a single photon traversing a beam splitter could violate a Bell inequality. Although initially debated, single-photon nonlocality was eventually demonstrated via homodyne measurements. Here, we present an alternate realisation that avoids the complexity of homodyne measurements and potential loopholes in their implementation. We violate a Bell inequality by performing joint measurements on two copies of the same single-photon entangled state, where one photon acts as a phase reference for the other, making it self-referential. We observe CHSH parameters of $2.71\\pm 0.09$ and $2.23\\pm 0.07$, depending on the joint measurements implemented. This offers a new perspective on single-photon nonlocality and a more accessible experimental route, potentially applicable to general mode-entangled states in diverse platforms."}

Coherent contributions to the pulse unitary that would traditionally be considered sources of error are treated as part of the gate definition, and compensated in software via single-qubit rotations. This approach enables rapid device-wide generation of high-fidelity two-qubit entangling gates, which are combined with standard calibrated gates to produce an expanded gate set. We show how these gates are directly usable as part of a quantum compiler, synthesizing generic two-qubit circuit blocks into minimal-duration sequences of the characterized gates interleaved with compensating single-qubit rotations. Benchmarking against circuits compiled using the default $CX$ gate alone on 127-qubit IBM hardware shows up to 7X improvement in success probability for Quantum Fourier Transform circuits up to 26 qubits, and up to 9X lower mean-square error in Trotter simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model.

Utilizing distributed cores, each hosting logical data qubits and logical ancillas connected via classical and quantum communication channels, offers a promising alternative. However, building such a system for logical qubits requires additional optimizations, such as minimizing the amount of state transfer between cores for inter-core two-qubit gates and optimizing the routing of magic states distilled in a magic state factory. In this work, we investigate such a system and its statistics in terms of classical and quantum resources. First, we restrict our quantum gate set to a universal gate set consisting of CNOT, H, T, S, and Pauli gates. We then developed a framework that can take any quantum circuit, transpile it to our gate set using Qiskit, and then partition the qubits using the KaHIP graph partitioner to balanced partitions. Afterwards, we built an algorithm to map these graphs onto the 2D mesh of quantum cores by converting the problem into a Quadratic Assignment Problem with Fixed Assignment (QAPFA) to minimize the routing of leftover two-qubit gates between cores and the total travel of magic states from the magic state factory. Following this stage, the gates are scheduled using an algorithm that takes care of the timing of the gate set. As a final stage, our framework reports detailed statistics such as the number of classical communications, the number of EPR pairs and magic states consumed, and timing overheads for pre- and post- processing for inter-core state transfers. These results help to quantify both classical and quantum resources that are used in distributed logical quantum computing architectures."}

By tracking changes in the ellipticities of signal photons on femtosecond timescales in four-wave-mixing experiments, we first establish a method for information encoding based on exciton spin dynamics and biexciton correlations. Using single-photon detection, we then implement the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol by mapping these polarization states onto binary sequences.

As a demonstration, an ASCII message consisting of 56 bits is transmitted through the polarization states of photons emitted by 2D-OIHP quantum wells.

Instead of invoking a stochastic wavefunction collapse, the measurement process is modeled as a bidirectional informational update between a forward-evolving state and a backward-propagating effect, governed by a completely positive generator and its adjoint. Within this operator-based formalism, pre- and post-selected statistics are treated on an equal footing, yielding a unified description of both. The proposed scheme rigorously preserves complete positivity, normalization, and the no-signalling principle, and it is shown to satisfy Spohn's inequality for the associated quantum Markov semigroup, thereby ensuring non-negative entropy production within this setting. The framework admits a direct experimental interpretation across a range of scenarios, including weak measurements, EPR-Bell tests, homodyne detection, and photon counting. Furthermore, in the classical limit, the bidirectional update is demonstrated to reduce to the well-established Kalman filter and Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoother used in classical estimation theory. These results support the view that the apparent temporal asymmetry of quantum measurement arises not from fundamental dynamical irreversibility, but from informational conditioning, specifically, the one-sided way in which measurement outcomes are incorporated into our description. In this sense, the arrow of time in measurement theory may be understood as an arrow of information."}

Graph states are used in many applications, such as measurement-based quantum computation, as multipartite entangled resources. It is thus crucial to understand when two such states have the same entanglement, i.e. when they can be transformed into each other using only local operations. In this case, we say that the graph states are LU-equivalent (local unitary). If the local operations are restricted to the so-called Clifford group, we say that the graph states are LC-equivalent (local Clifford). Interestingly, a simple graph rule called local complementation fully captures LC-equivalence, in the sense that two graph states are LC-equivalent if and only if the underlying graphs are related by a sequence of local complementations. While it was once conjectured that two LU-equivalent graph states are always LC-equivalent, counterexamples do exist and local complementation fails to fully capture the entanglement of graph states. We introduce in this thesis a generalization of local complementation that does fully capture LU-equivalence. Using this characterization, we prove the existence of an infinite strict hierarchy of local equivalences between LC- and LU-equivalence. This also leads to the design of a quasi-polynomial algorithm for deciding whether two graph states are LU-equivalent, and to a proof that two LU-equivalent graph states are LC-equivalent if they are defined on at most 19 qubits. Furthermore, we study graph states that are universal in the sense that any smaller graph state, defined on any small enough set of qubits, can be induced using only local operations. We provide bounds and an optimal, probabilistic construction."}

Here, we introduce the nilpotency index $\\mathcal{K}$, which quantifies the depth of non-commutativity between operators during the encoding process, can act as a fundamental parameter governing quantum-enhanced sensing. We show that a finite $\\mathcal{K}$ yields an enhanced scaling of root-mean-square error as $N^{-(1+\\mathcal{K})}$. Meanwhile, the requirement for indefinite causal order arises only when the nested commutators become constant.

To reach their full potential, CV platforms need to be able to efficiently implement non-Gaussian operations.

Here, we introduce a method for implementing arbitrary non-Gaussian operations applicable to both single- and multi-mode systems, allowing the generation of both anharmonicities and nonlinear multi-mode couplings. Our method synthesizes a target Hamiltonian by decomposing it into a Fourier series whose terms are implemented via bosonic quantum signal processing, which uses a discrete-variable (DV) system to induce a nonlinearity in the CV system. Our hybrid CV-DV protocol allows for the direct simulation of a broad range of CV phenomena (such as those in lattice gauge theory, chemical dynamics, and quantum chaos) and provides a richer toolbox for CV circuit compilation."}

Utilizing a graph neural network, RELiQ learns graph representations and avoids overfitting to specific network topologies - a prevalent issue for learning-based approaches. Our approach, trained on random graphs, consistently outperforms existing local information heuristics and learning-based approaches when applied to random and real-world topologies.

Consequently, even when the total resource quantity is conserved, its quality decreases. This is quantified by the resource purity metric, $η$. Our theory provides greater detail than conventional approaches that rely solely on monotonicity. It also establishes a new framework for understanding quantum resource dynamics.

However, qubits typically have multilevel structures making them prone to unwanted transitions from fast gates. This leakage out of the computational subspace is especially detrimental to algorithms as it has been observed to cause long-lived errors, such as in quantum error correction. This forces a choice between either achieving fast gates or having low leakage. Previous works focus on suppressing leakage by mitigating the first to second excited state transition, overlooking multi-photon transitions, and achieving faster gates with further reductions in leakage has remained elusive. Here, we demonstrate single qubit gates with a total leakage error consistently below $2.0\\times10^{-5}$, and obtain fidelities above $99.98\\%$ for pulse durations down to 6.8 ns for both $X$ and $X/2$ gates. This is achieved by removing direct transitions beyond nearest-neighbor levels using a double recursive implementation of the Derivative Removal by Adiabatic Gate (DRAG) method, which we name the R2D method. Moreover, we find that at such short gate durations and strong driving strengths the main error source is from these higher order transitions. This is all shown in the widely-used superconducting transmon qubit, which has a weakly anharmonic level structure and suffers from higher order transitions significantly. We also introduce an approach for amplifying leakage error that can precisely quantify leakage rates below $10^{-6}$. The presented approach can be readily applied to other qubit types as well."}

There is a stronger version, known as supercatalysis, in which the borrowed catalyst is returned in an enhanced form, i.e. more entangled. However, this phenomenon has remained little explored. In this work we introduce the supercatalytic entanglement gain as a figure of merit taking values in [0,1] that quantifies the performance of the protocol (with 0 corresponding to the standard case of catalysis and 1 representing the maximal possible gain) and we study in which cases it can be greater than zero and which strategies can maximize it. While it turns out that every catalytic transformation can be implemented in a supercatalytic fashion with entanglement gain equal to 1 if the state that is borrowed is chosen appropriately, other choices can make the gain strictly less than 1 and even 0. In fact, we prove that a large class of catalytic transformations are not fully supercatalyzable, i.e. there is at least one choice of catalyst for which the entanglement gain vanishes. On the other hand, the construction that shows that supercatalysis is always possible with maximal gain uses artificially highly entangled catalysts. For this reason, we also study minimal supercatalysis, where the entanglement content of the borrowed state is constrained in a precise and natural way. While we consider a scenario where we prove it is impossible to have entanglement gain equal to 1 in this case, we show that there exist minimal supercatalytic transformations with gain as close to 1 as desired. We also explore several examples and observe that, although choosing a catalyst with the least possible entanglement is often an optimal strategy for minimal supercatalysis, this is not necessarily always the case."}

We present results of the Lindblad equation in the presence and absence of Kac rescaling of the coupling constant. Our results show that for a linear coupling and a harmonic model of the environment, often used in modeling of a quantum interferometer coupled with an environment, the Heisenberg-limited sensitivity may be restored after the Kac rescaling. This result points out the need and the importance to characterize the (model of the) environment of the interferometer at hand."}

Here, we report the realization of a photon-pressure platform, in which a GHz circuit interacts with a MHz circuit via a magnetic-flux-tunable combination of dispersive and dissipative photon-pressure.

We analyze how fluctuations in qubit frequency, drive amplitude, and coherence affect gate performance over time. The robust pulses suppress coherent errors from drive amplitude drifts over 15 times more than a Gaussian pulse with derivative removal by adiabatic gate (DRAG) corrections.

The classical search for such generators has so far relied on greedy construction steps applied to an exponentially growing number of candidate operators, making it rapidly computationally intractable. We propose a general, polynomial-scaling and optimal strategy, based on Lie-Algebraic basic properties, to overcome this bottleneck. It allows for the efficient construction of these generators, also known as Minimal Complete Pools (MCPs), for a target Lie Algebra. As an immediate application, efficiently constructing user-defined MCPs that respect fermionic algebra is crucial in the context of adaptive Variational Quantum Eigensolver for quantum chemistry. Thus, we introduce MB-ADAPT-VQE, which incorporates optimally constructed MCPs into batched ADAPT-VQE to reduce quantum resources and improve convergence under strong correlation. These MCPs also unlock fixed-ansatz methods based on a Lie-algebraic structure such as the gradient-free NI-DUCC-VQE, enabling simulations surpassing prior MCP limits.

We characterize the zero-phonon lines of these modified divacancies and reveal a distinct temperature-dependent behavior in the spin-readout contrast. By systematically optimizing the implantation dose and annealing temperature, we further achieve high-density ensembles and observe clear Rabi-oscillation beating patterns associated with different orientations of basal-type defects.

In case of the Compton scattering of both photons the phenomenon of quantum entanglement leads to a measurable increase in the azimuthal correlations of scattered photons, as opposed to a classical description treating the two scattering events as independent. The probability of the scattering of the system of the entangled photons is described by the Pryce-Ward cross section dependent on a difference of the azimuthal scattering angles in the fixed coordinate frame, while the independent scattering of single photons is described by the Klein-Nishina cross section dependent on the azimuthal angle relative to each photon's initial polarization. Since the singlet state of orthogonal polarizations is rotationally invariant, it does not carry any physical information on the initial polarizations of the single annihilation photons. In such bipartite state the angular origin for the Klein-Nishina cross section is undefined, making the Pryce-Ward and Klein-Nishina descriptions mutually exclusive. However, semi-classical simulations of the joint Compton scattering of entangled photons - implementing the Pryce-Ward cross section, but still treating the two photons as separate entities - can reconcile the Pryce-Ward correlations with the Klein-Nishina statistics for single photons by implementing a modified version of a scattering cross section presented in this work."}

Quantum granules are modeled as effects on a finite dimensional Hilbert space, so granular memberships are given by Born probabilities. This operator theoretic viewpoint provides a common language for sharp (projective) and soft (nonprojective) granules and embeds granulation directly into the standard formalism of quantum information theory. We establish foundational results for effect based quantum granules, including normalization and monotonicity properties, the emergence of Boolean islands from commuting families, granular refinement under Luders updates, and the evolution of granules under quantum channels via the adjoint channel in the Heisenberg picture. We connect QGC with quantum detection and estimation theory by interpreting the effect operators realizing Helstrom minimum error measurement for binary state discrimination as Helstrom type decision granules, i.e., soft quantum counterparts of Bayes optimal decision regions. Building on these results, we introduce Quantum Granular Decision Systems (QGDS) with three reference architectures that specify how quantum granules can be defined, learned, and integrated with classical components while remaining compatible with near term quantum hardware. Case studies on qubit granulation, two qubit parity effects, and Helstrom style soft decisions illustrate how QGC reproduces fuzzy like graded memberships and smooth decision boundaries while exploiting noncommutativity, contextuality, and entanglement. The framework thus provides a unified and mathematically grounded basis for operator valued granules in quantum information processing, granular reasoning, and intelligent systems."}

In particular, they showed how the classical decodability of Reed-Solomon codes can be leveraged to solve the Optimal Polynomial Intersection (OPI) problem quantumly. This approach was further improved by Chailloux and Tillich using stronger soft decoders, though their analysis was restricted to a specific setting of OPI. In this work, we reconcile these two approaches. We build on a recent formulation of the reduction by Chailloux and Hermouet in the lattice-based setting, which we rewrite in the language of codes. With this reduction, we show that the results of Jordan et al. can be recovered under Bernoulli noise models, simplifying the analysis.

In the single-mode regime, the external drive parameters-the detuning and Rabi frequency-precisely tune the positions and number of reflection peaks, allowing dynamic spectral engineering. In the multi-mode regime, quantum interference between modes governs the scattering dynamics. When the input photon is prepared in a specific coherent superposition, multi-mode effects restore single-mode-like behavior, enabling Fano-mediated complete reflection. Conversely, a single-mode input prevents complete reflection even at the Fano resonance, while EIT-driven transmission persists.

This poses a practical challenge to delivering VQA-enabled intelligence on QIoT endpoints, which often have few qubits, constrained shot budgets, and strict latency requirements. In this paper, we present a novel approach for escaping barren plateaus by including negative learning rates into the optimization process in QIoT devices. Our method introduces controlled instability into model training by switching between positive and negative learning phases, allowing recovery of significant gradients and exploring flatter areas in the loss landscape. We theoretically evaluate the effect of negative learning on gradient variance and propose conditions under which it helps escape from barren zones. The experimental findings on typical VQA benchmarks show consistent improvements in both convergence and simulation results over traditional optimizers.

Connecting to a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), the TX contains a voltage-mode driver with current-mode injection for low-power output-swing-boosting and 3-tap feed-forward equalization (FFE). This link has been demonstrated in the control and readout of a complete superconducting quantum computing system."}

However, recent studies find that even drives far below the superconducting gap frequency may cause drive-induced quasiparticle generation (QPG) across Josephson junctions (JJs), posing a serious concern for fault-tolerant superconducting quantum computing. Here, we find experimental evidence that the actual QPG rates in strongly driven SCQs are remarkably lower than expected. We apply intense drive fields through readout resonators, reaching effective qubit drive amplitudes up to 300 GHz. The nonlinear response of the resonators enables quantification of the energy loss from SCQs into their environments, including the contribution from QPG. Even when conservatively attributing all measured dissipation to QPG, the observed energy dissipation rates are far lower than expected from the ideal QPG model. Meanwhile, calculations incorporating high-frequency cutoffs (HFCs) near 17-20 GHz in the QPG conductance can explain the experiments. These HFCs yield QPG rates a few orders of magnitude smaller than those without HFCs, providing evidence that the QPG rates are lower than predicted by the ideal model. Our findings prevent overestimation of drive-induced QPG and provide crucial guidance for operating superconducting quantum processors. Identifying the microscopic origin of the discrepancy opens new material and device opportunities to further mitigate QPG."}

In this work, we present two systematic benchmarks that evaluate these quantum processors at scale. We use the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) to solve maximal independent set (MIS) instances of random unit-disk graphs. These benchmarks are scalable, relying not on prior knowledge of the system's evolution but on the quality of the MIS solutions obtained. We benchmark quera_aquila and pasqal_fresnel on problem sizes up to 102 and 85 qubits, respectively. Overall, quera_aquila performs better on QAOA and QAA instances. Finally, we generate MIS instances of up to 1000 qubits, providing scalable benchmarks for evaluating future, larger processors as they become available."}

The motivation for this result is to establish a notion of quantum relative entropy in the space of pure state distributions, which are the resulting objects of unravelings of the Lindblad equation, such as the stochastic Schrödinger equation.

Motivated by this question, we propose an essential geometric perspective on quantum cryptography in which projective Hilbert space and its entanglement foliations play a central role. The basic ingredients are: (a) the Fubini-Study metric on the manifold of pure states, (b) a family of entanglement measures viewed as scalar functions on this manifold, and (c) controlled trajectories generated by unitary operations.\n  The geometric structure -- state manifold, metric, and allowed moves -- is fully public, as is the functional form of the entanglement family. What remains secret is the choice of parameter $θ$ that selects a specific entanglement functional $E_θ$ and the corresponding foliation into constant-entanglement hypersurfaces. In this setting, classical messages are encoded not only in the sequence of states but also in the pattern of upward, downward, or tangential steps with respect to the hidden foliation. We formalize this idea in terms of geometric entanglement codes and illustrate it with two toy constructions in which incompatible foliations play the role of mutually unbiased bases."}

These resonances yield dual reflection bands with asymmetric linewidths, whose spectral positions and bandwidths can be tuned through the control-field parameters, dipole orientation, incident geometry, and lattice constant. We further identify the conditions under which additional diffraction orders emerge, which delineate the operational and tunable range of the atomic mirror via its collective-mode structure.

However, the energy that can be stored during a coherent charging process is limited due to coherent oscillations between the charger and battery. In this Letter, we show that by introducing a slow quench in the interaction between a coherently driven quadratic oscillator battery and a charger system, the maximum battery power ($P_{B,m}$) scales algebraically with the quench duration ($τ_Q$), i.e., $P_{B,m} \\propto τ_Q^α$, where $0<α\\leq2$ is a function of the quench ramp exponent. This finding implies that, counterintuitively, slower quenches lead to faster charging. Such a quench suppresses coherent energy oscillations between the battery and the charger, allowing an unbounded increase in power. Furthermore, we discuss the effect of charger dissipation, which imposes a finite limit on the maximum power. We also show that the temporal extensive scaling occurs in a broader context by mapping the system to a coherently driven Tavis-Cummings battery."}

We formally prove this isomorphism and show that for physical Hamiltonians with bounded locality and interaction degree, the resulting graph has a bounded degree, reducing the computational problem of finding the automorphism group to polynomial time. The algorithm's validity is empirically confirmed on various physical models with known symmetries. We further show that the problem of deciding whether two Hamiltonians are permutation-equivalent is polynomial-time reducible to the graph isomorphism problem using our graph representation.

Using a Takens embedding of the Lorenz system together with a resource-efficient quantum phase estimation implemented on IBM quantum hardware, we observe that the spectral gap of the SUSY Laplacian tracks the persistence of homological structures. Notably, the minimum of this spectral gap coincides with the onset of chaos, whereas its reopening reflects the geometric maturation of the attractor. Validated on small complexes yet offering an exponential advantage over classical diagonalization (from $O(N^3)$ to $\\mathrm{poly}(\\log N)$), this framework suggests that quantum hardware can function as a spectrometer for data topologies beyond classical reach."}

Nonstabilizerness is a fundamental resource for quantum advantage, and efficient SRE estimations are highly beneficial in practical applications. We address the nonstabilizerness estimation problem through three supervised learning formulations starting from easier classification tasks to the more challenging regression task. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN manages to capture meaningful features from the graph-based circuit representation, resulting in robust generalization performances achieved across diverse scenarios. In classification tasks, the GNN is trained on product states and generalizes on circuits evolved under Clifford operations, entangled states, and circuits with higher number of qubits. In the regression task, the GNN significantly improves the SRE estimation on out-of-distribution circuits with higher number of qubits and gate counts compared to previous work, for both random quantum circuits and structured circuits derived from the transverse-field Ising model. Moreover, the graph representation of quantum circuits naturally integrates hardware-specific information.

Employing a purification-based approach, we prove that mixed-state saturation occurs precisely when three structural criteria are fulfilled: the state's support is confined to the sum of two energy eigenspaces (the ground level and a single excited level); each eigenvector of the state with nonzero weight is a fixed superposition of one ground- and one excited-state energy eigenvector (determined by the minimizer of the objective function identified by Giovannetti et al.) and all such eigenvectors evolve in mutually orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces. These requirements impose a strict rank bound, ruling out saturation by any faithful state. For qubit systems, we derive a purity-resolved and tight Margolus-Levitin bound that reduces to the pure-state result in the limit of unit purity. Through a time-reversal argument, we further extend the dual Margolus-Levitin quantum speed limit to mixed states and establish the corresponding saturation conditions."}

This can be achieved with optical resonators that increase the local density of states, thereby enhancing the radiative decay of emitters on a specific transition. However, small mode volumes and high quality factors are required in this approach, which restricts the multiplexing capacity and necessitates precise tuning of the resonator frequency. Here, we demonstrate an alternative method that avoids these bottlenecks for up-scaling. Instead of strongly enhancing the emission on a selected transition, we suppress all other radiative decay channels by tailoring the photonic bandgap of a W1 silicon photonic crystal waveguide. In such a device, we can spectrally resolve and individually address tens of erbium dopants. We find that their emission is channeled to the desired transition, ensuring efficient collection. At the same time, their lifetimes are preserved or even extended compared to the bulk in a broad spectral range. Furthermore, the extended mode volume facilitates a low dopant concentration and thus a large spatial separation between the emitters, avoiding unwanted interactions that would limit their coherence. The demonstrated approach of inhibiting unwanted spontaneous emission can be combined with Purcell enhancement and applied to other leading spin-qubit platforms. It thus opens intriguing perspectives for photonic quantum technologies."}

This formalism utilizes cubature formulas from multivariate approximation theory, which connect the continuous geometry of the phase space to discrete, weighted point sets, ensuring the conditions for error correction are met. We demonstrate that this framework provides a unifying perspective, revealing that well-established codes, such as cat codes and the recently proposed quantum spherical codes (QSCs), are specific instances of QCCs corresponding to uniform weights on a single energy shell. The QCC formalism unlocks a vast new design space, encompassing non-uniform superpositions and multi-shell configurations. We leverage this framework to discover several new families of codes derived from Euclidean designs, allowing for greater geometric separation between logical states, which correlates with improved performance under photon loss.

First, we learn an open-system model from experimental data collected in an initial time window of quench dynamics, simulate the corresponding master equation, and quantitatively verify consistency between theoretical predictions and measured dynamics at long times. Second, we establish error bounds directly from experimental measurements alone, without relying on classical simulation--crucial for entering regimes of quantum advantage. The learned models reproduce the experimental evolution within the predicted bounds, demonstrating quantitative reliability and internal consistency.

We demonstrate that the manifesting HSF is captured by a dephasing PXP model that supports multiple degenerate zero modes. These modes form disconnected, block-diagonal subspaces of maximally mixed states, which consist of many-body spin states sharing the same symmetry. A key result is the identification of the underlying symmetry in the HSF, where conserved quantities in each subspace are defined by the consecutive double excitation addressing operator.

Near-maximal entanglement arises in systems exhibiting thermalization or pre-thermalization, where the system converges to a steady state with a fixed energy density. Classical simulation of the time dependence of such wave functions requires exponential resources. However, typical computations aim to estimate expectation values of local operators and correlation functions to some expected precision. For thermalizing systems at sufficiently high energy densities, such computations do not require storing the full wave function. Nonetheless, constructing classical algorithms for intermediate energy densities has remained a challenge. In this paper, we propose a heuristic approach to accelerate the convergence of Matrix Product State (MPS) simulations of expectation values applicable in a broad range of energy densities. We estimate the desired observables by rescaling the MPS results at low bond dimensions with a factor that depends only on the fidelity of the MPS wave function. Using this technique, we simulated the dynamics of the two-dimensional Transverse-Field Ising Model (TFIM) on a $7\\times8$ grid with periodic boundary conditions, using a maximum bond dimension of $χ= 4096$ on a single A100 GPU. We compared our results to similar TFIM simulations on a digital quantum processor."}

We use this notion to give a full characterisation of the existence of commutativity gadgets for relational structures, introduced by Ji as a method for achieving quantum soundness of classical CSP reductions. Prior to our work, a classification was only known in the Boolean case [Culf--Mastel, STOC'25]. As an application of our framework, we prove that the entangled CSP parameterised by odd cycles is undecidable. Furthermore, we establish a quantum version of Galois connection for entangled CSPs in the case of non-oracular quantum homomorphisms."}

Here we give a remarkably simple construction of this channel, making its known properties -- and several new ones -- immediately transparent. In particular, we show that the channel also purifies non-i.i.d. states: it transforms any permutationally symmetric state into a uniform convex combination of permutationally symmetric purifications, each differing only by a tensor-product unitary acting on the purifying system. We then apply the channel to give a one-line proof of (a stronger version of) the recently established Uhlmann's theorem for quantum divergences."}

In this work, a novel data-driven method for inferring such parameters from first-moment dynamics is presented using an open 2D quantum harmonic oscillator as an example. The method relies on the discrete spectrum of the Koopman operator to obtain such parameters, which is obtained using the multichannel Hankel Alternative View of Koopman (mHAVOK) algorithm; a theoretical connection of such affirmation is presented. The method is tested on the expected value of noiseless quadratures, retrieving oscillation frequencies, damping rates, nonlinear Kerr shifts, qubit-photon coupling strengths of a Jaynes-Cummings interaction, and a modulated frequency of a time-dependent Hamiltonian. The majority of the recovered parameters remained within 5% of their true values. When compared to Fourier and matrix-pencil estimators, our approach yields lower errors for dynamics with strong dissipation. Overall, these findings suggest that Koopman operator theory provides a practical framework for studying quantum dynamical systems."}
