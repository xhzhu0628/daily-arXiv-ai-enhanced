Abstract: We investigate quantum quenches starting from a critical point and
experimentally probe the associated defect statistics using a trapped-ion
quantum simulator of the transverse-field Ising model. The cumulants of the
defect number distribution exhibit universal scaling with quench depth,
featuring Gaussian behavior at leading order and systematic subleading
corrections. Our results are in excellent agreement with both exact and
approximate theoretical predictions, establishing quench-depth scaling as a
powerful and precise experimental benchmark for nonequilibrium quantum critical
dynamics.

Abstract: A recent work (Li, 2406.01204) considered quantum simulation of Quantum
Electrodynamics (QED) on a lattice in the Coulomb gauge with gauge degrees of
freedom represented in the occupation basis in momentum space. Here we consider
representing the gauge degrees of freedom in field basis in position space and
develop a quantum algorithm for real-time simulation. We show that the Coulomb
gauge Hamiltonian is equivalent to the temporal gauge Hamiltonian when acting
on physical states consisting of fermion and transverse gauge fields. The
Coulomb gauge Hamiltonian guarantees that the unphysical longitudinal gauge
fields do not propagate and thus there is no need to impose any constraint. The
local gauge field basis and the canonically conjugate variable basis are
swapped efficiently using the quantum Fourier transform. We prove that the
qubit cost to represent physical states and the gate depth for real-time
simulation scale polynomially with the lattice size, energy, time, accuracy and
Hamiltonian parameters. We focus on the lattice theory without discussing the
continuum limit or the UV completion of QED.

Result: 相比基线方法，电路重排序策略显著降低了分布成本。

Conclusion: araQne编译器在优化分布式量子计算中发挥了关键作用，为量子网络基础设施提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Just as classical computing relies on distributed systems, the quantum
computing era requires new kinds of infrastructure and software tools. Quantum
networks will become the backbone of hybrid, quantum-augmented data centers, in
which quantum algorithms are distributed over a local network of quantum
processing units (QPUs) interconnected via shared entanglement. In this
context, it is crucial to develop methods and software that minimize the number
of inter-QPU communications. Here we describe key features of the quantum
compiler araQne, which is designed to minimize distribution cost, measured by
the number of entangled pairs required to distribute a monolithic quantum
circuit using gate teleportation protocols. We establish the crucial role
played by circuit reordering strategies, which strongly reduce the distribution
cost compared to a baseline approach.

Conclusion: 该协议为分布式参数估计提供了一种安全且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Anonymity and privacy are two key functionalities in modern communication
networks. In quantum networks, distributed quantum sensing has emerged as a
powerful use case, with applications to clock synchronisation, detecting
gravitational effects and more. In this work, we develop a new protocol
combining the different cryptographic functionalities of anonymity and privacy
for the task of distributed parameter estimation. That is, we present a
protocol that allows a selected subset of network participants to anonymously
collaborate in estimating the average of their private parameters. Crucially,
this is achieved without disclosing either the individual parameter values or
the identities of the participants, neither to each other nor to the broader
network. Our approach builds on a modified scheme that preserves the distinct
security guarantees of existing protocols, while avoiding potential
vulnerabilities that could arise from applying those protocols sequentially.

### [5] [A Stochastic Schrödinger Equation for the Generalized Rate Operator Unravelings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01107)

Conclusion: 广义速率算子解缠形式在开放量子系统动力学中具有高效性和实用性，可用于检测非物理演化。

Abstract: Stochastic unravelings are a widely used tool to solve open quantum system
dynamics, in which the exact solution is obtained via an average over a
stochastic process on the set of pure quantum states. Recently, the generalized
rate operator unraveling formalism was derived, allowing not only for an
engineering of the stochastic realizations, but also to unravel without reverse
jumps even for some dynamics in which P-divisibility is violated, thus hugely
improving the simulation efficiency. This is possible because the unraveling
depend on an arbitrary non-linear transformation which can incorporate the
memory effects. In this work, a stochastic Schr\"odinger equation for this
formalism is derived, both for cases with and without reverse jumps. It is also
shown that a failure of this method can be used to witness master equations
leading unphysical time evolutions, independently on the particular non-linear
transformation considered.

Conclusion: 该方法无需测量先验信息，独立于层析规范自由度，能验证所有纠缠态，且无需辅助纠缠源。

Abstract: By combining the assumption of Bell locality with that of generalized
noncontextuality, we define different classes of noncontextuality inequalities
for correlations in a bipartite Bell scenario, with the classes being
distinguished by which set of operational identities are taken into account,
with certain natural subsets defining a hierarchy of classes. We prove that
violations of the inequalities at different levels of the hierarchy can witness
that a bipartite state is entangled, steerable, or nonlocal, respectively,
thereby providing a means of certifying these different forms of quantum
correlations. To illustrate the power of this approach, we demonstrate the
violation of one such inequality in an experiment with polarization-entangled
photons. This allows us to certify entanglement in certain qubit isotropic
states for which certification by Bell or steering inequalities is known to be
impossible. Our entanglement certification scheme is the first to combine all
of the following desirable features: it requires no prior characterization of
the measurements, it delivers a verdict based on quantities that are
independent of the tomographic gauge freedom, it is able to certify any
entangled state, and it requires no auxiliary entangled sources.

### [7] [Quantum Computing in Discrete- and Continuous-Variable Architectures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01146)
*Shraddha Singh*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个混合连续变量（CV）和离散变量（DV）量子系统的理论框架，重点研究量子控制、态制备和纠错。核心贡献是非阿贝尔量子信号处理（NA-QSP）和高斯控制旋转（GCR）协议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 为混合CV-DV架构的可扩展、容错量子计算奠定了基础，适用于逻辑门合成、读出和混合算法设计。

Abstract: This thesis develops a theoretical framework for hybrid continuous-variable
(CV) and discrete-variable (DV) quantum systems, with emphasis on quantum
control, state preparation, and error correction. A central contribution is
non-abelian quantum signal processing (NA-QSP), a generalization of quantum
signal processing to settings where control parameters are non-commuting
operators. Within this framework, we introduce the Gaussian-Controlled-Rotation
(GCR) protocol, which enables high-fidelity control of CV states using DV
ancillae. This approach allows for deterministic preparation of squeezed, cat,
and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) states without numerical optimization.
  Two previously unpublished contributions are included: (i) Chapter 2.3
introduces the Gaussian hierarchy, a classification of CV operations analogous
to the Clifford hierarchy, offering a new lens for understanding CV gate sets;
(ii) Chapter 5 presents an analytical framework for correcting photon loss in
finite-energy GKP codes, introducing the notion of probabilistic error
correction, providing insight into recent GKP experiments surpassing break-even
thresholds.
  Overall, this work lays the groundwork for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum
computation in hybrid CV-DV architectures, with applications to logical gate
synthesis, readout, and hybrid algorithm design using ancilla oscillators.

Abstract: Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the
coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect
origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the
temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a
low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge
noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an
approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law
dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that
the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields,
suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled
defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis,
motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies
approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer
insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories
of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视频繁噪声自适应转译的必要性，以优化量子电路性能。

Result: 发现噪声转译导致工作负载集中在少数量子比特上，随机映射可缓解此问题；单次编译的电路可重复使用。

Conclusion: 提出减少开销的轻量级方案，提升量子工作流程效率。

Abstract: Transpilation, particularly noise-aware optimization, is widely regarded as
essential for maximizing the performance of quantum circuits on superconducting
quantum computers. The common wisdom is that each circuit should be transpiled
using up-to-date noise calibration data to optimize fidelity. In this work, we
revisit the necessity of frequent noise-adaptive transpilation, conducting an
in-depth empirical study across five IBM 127-qubit quantum computers and 16
diverse quantum algorithms. Our findings reveal novel and interesting insights:
(1) noise-aware transpilation leads to a heavy concentration of workloads on a
small subset of qubits, which increases output error variability; (2) using
random mapping can mitigate this effect while maintaining comparable average
fidelity; and (3) circuits compiled once with calibration data can be reliably
reused across multiple calibration cycles and time periods without significant
loss in fidelity. These results suggest that the classical overhead associated
with daily, per-circuit noise-aware transpilation may not be justified. We
propose lightweight alternatives that reduce this overhead without sacrificing
fidelity -- offering a path to more efficient and scalable quantum workflows.

Abstract: The practical application of quantum technologies to chemical problems faces
significant challenges, particularly in the treatment of realistic basis sets
and the accurate inclusion of electron correlation effects. A direct approach
to these problems is currently infeasible due to limitations in the number of
logical qubits, their fidelity, and the shallow circuit depths supported by
existing hardware; all of which hinder simulations at the required level of
accuracy. A promising alternative is hybrid quantum-classical computing, where
classical resources are used to construct effective Hamiltonians characterized
by dimensions that conform to the constraints of current quantum devices. In
this paper, we demonstrate the performance of a hybrid approach:
coupled-cluster downfolded Hamiltonians are first evaluated in
reduced-dimensionality active spaces, and the corresponding ground-state
energies are subsequently computed using quantum algorithms. Our comprehensive
analysis explores the achievable accuracy in recovering correlation energies
when hundreds of orbitals are downfolded into a problem size tractable by
today's quantum hardware. We argue that such flexible hybrid algorithms, where
problem size can be tailored to available quantum resources, can serve as a
bridge between noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices and future
fault-tolerant quantum computers, marking a step toward the early realization
of quantum advantage in chemistry.

### [11] [Testing Determinism and the Role of Time in Atoms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01203)
*Mark G. Raizen*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文提出实验测试原子中时间与决定论的作用，重点分析稳定同位素随时间变化的可能性，并探讨核磁矩时间依赖性对同位素生命周期追踪的潜在影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 通过测量新创建与自然界中稳定同位素的超精细分裂差异，分析锶-87、镥-175、镥-176等案例，并提议使用双原子钟阶梯配置测试电子跃迁老化。

Result: 研究发现核磁矩的时间依赖性可能实现同位素生命周期的确定性追踪，并预测放射性同位素的年龄与衰变时间。

Conclusion: 论文表明原子跃迁可能随时间变化，核磁矩或电子电荷分布的变化是潜在原因，为未来实验设计提供了方向。

Abstract: We propose and analyze experiments to test determinism and the role of time
in atoms. As a first step, we consider experiments to test if stable isotopes
change over time. The idea is to measure the hyperfine splitting for newly
created stable isotopes and compare them to the same isotopes found in nature.
The three cases analyzed are strontium-87 with an odd number of neutrons,
lutetium-175 with an odd number of protons, and lutetium-176 with an odd number
of protons and neutrons. These experiments would search for possible changes in
the nuclear magnetic moment of isotopes since they were first created during
nucleosynthesis. We propose that a time-dependent nuclear magnetic moment may
enable deterministic tracking of the life cycle of an isotope, and prediction
of age since creation and time until decay of radioisotopes. The case of
thulium-170 is analyzed, it is particularly interesting as a radioisotope with
an odd number of protons and neutrons. More generally, we argue that any atomic
transition could change in time, either due to the atomic nucleus or to the
electron charge distribution. The latter could be tested in a dual atomic clock
in a ladder configuration to search for the aging of an electronic transition.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合Sagnac干涉仪和法拉第镜的实验装置，用于稳定双场量子密钥分发中的相位和偏振波动。

Result: 实验结果显示72小时内干涉可见度保持在95.3%，标准差为0.47%。

Conclusion: 该装置适用于多用户场景，如星型网络或总线拓扑。

Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution requires first-order interference between
coherent states sent by Alice and Bob in a mid-station Charlie. In order to
obtain stable operation and maximum interferometric visibility, not only phase
stabilization but also polarization control is required, especially in
optical-fiber setups. In this paper, we propose an experimental setup that
simultaneously provides passive stabilization of phase and polarization
fluctuations by combining a Sagnac-like interferometer with a "Plug-and-Play"
configuration employing Faraday mirrors. Experimental results show a net
interferometric visibility maintained around 95.3% during 72 hours of
continuous operation, with a standard deviation of 0.47%. The setup can be
straightforwardly adapted to a multi-user scenario employing either a star
network, a bus topology, or a combination of both.

Result: 结果证明了最坏情况下的门保真度下限，适用于量子比特、多级量子位和辅助操作。

Conclusion: 结论是该界限为鲁棒控制合成和系统识别提供了定量目标，并可作为硬件平台的认证标准。

Abstract: We derive a universal performance limit for coherent quantum control in the
presence of modeled and unmodeled uncertainties. For any target unitary $W$
that is implementable in the absence of error, we prove that the worst-case
(and hence the average) gate fidelity obeys the lower bound $F \ge
\Flb\bigl(\tf \Omeff\bigr)$, where $\tf$ is the gate duration and $\Omeff$ is a
single frequency-like measure that aggregates \emph{all} bounded uncertainty
sources, e.g., coherent control imperfections, unknown couplings, and residual
environment interactions, without assuming an initially factorizable
system-bath state or a completely positive map. The bound is obtained by
combining an interaction-picture averaging method with a Bellman-Gronwall
inequality and holds for any finite-norm Hamiltonian decomposition. Hence it
applies equally to qubits, multi-level qudits, and ancilla-assisted operations.
Because $\Flb$ depends only on the dimensionless product $\tf\Omeff$, it yields
a device-independent metric that certifies whether a given hardware platform
can, in principle, reach a specified fault-tolerance threshold, and also sets a
quantitative target for robust-control synthesis and system identification.

Motivation: 解决现有量子互联协议中CAPS方法在保真度和速率上的限制，提升其性能。

Method: 改进协议并分析原子-腔动力学，提出时间复用操作和混合网络配置。

Result: 实现了0.999的保真度和高率纠缠生成，预计速率可达10^6 s^-1。

Conclusion: CAPS协议成为扩展量子信息平台的高效方案。

Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block
of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS)
approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based
on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success
probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining
a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or
intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a
primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity
and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing
protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations
by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity
dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities
are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses
required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed
operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate
entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration
leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for
external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a
concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal
cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times
10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup
beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength
channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading
candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.

Conclusion: 首次实现了完全基于经典测量数据的QML层析方案，为当前量子平台上的实用量子态重构提供了可扩展路径。

Abstract: Reconstructing quantum states from measurement data represents a formidable
challenge in quantum information science, especially as system sizes grow
beyond the reach of traditional tomography methods. While recent studies have
explored quantum machine learning (QML) for quantum state tomography (QST),
nearly all rely on idealized assumptions, such as direct access to the unknown
quantum state as quantum data input, which are incompatible with current
hardware constraints. In this work, we present a QML-based tomography protocol
that operates entirely on classical measurement data and is fully executable on
noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Our approach employs a
variational quantum circuit trained to reconstruct quantum states based solely
on measurement outcomes. We test the method in simulation, achieving
high-fidelity reconstructions of diverse quantum states, including GHZ states,
spin chain ground states, and states generated by random circuits. The protocol
is then validated on quantum hardware from IBM and IonQ. Additionally, we
demonstrate accurate tomography is possible using incomplete measurement bases,
a crucial step towards scaling up our protocol. Our results in various
scenarios illustrate successful state reconstruction with fidelity reaching 90%
or higher. To our knowledge, this is the first QML-based tomography scheme that
uses exclusively classical measurement data and has been implemented on real
quantum processors. This work establishes the feasibility of QML-based
tomography on current quantum platforms and offers a scalable pathway for
practical quantum state reconstruction.

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了量子密码学中的单向谜题（OWPuzzs）与分布学习难度的关系，首次建立了OWPuzzs与量子分布学习难度的完整表征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究量子密码学中单向谜题的存在性及其与计算复杂性假设（如PP≠BQP）的关系，填补了此前缺乏相关表征的空白。

Method: 通过分析量子分布学习的难度（包括平均情况和最坏情况），建立了OWPuzzs与学习难度的等价性。

Result: 证明了OWPuzzs的存在性与量子分布学习的平均难度等价，并探讨了PP≠BQP与学习难度的其他联系。

Conclusion: 论文首次完整表征了OWPuzzs与量子分布学习难度的关系，为量子密码学的基础理论提供了新视角。

Abstract: The existence of one-way functions (OWFs) forms the minimal assumption in
classical cryptography. However, this is not necessarily the case in quantum
cryptography. One-way puzzles (OWPuzzs), introduced by Khurana and Tomer,
provide a natural quantum analogue of OWFs. The existence of OWPuzzs implies
$PP\neq BQP$, while the converse remains open. In classical cryptography, the
analogous problem-whether OWFs can be constructed from $P \neq NP$-has long
been studied from the viewpoint of hardness of learning. Hardness of learning
in various frameworks (including PAC learning) has been connected to OWFs or to
$P \neq NP$. In contrast, no such characterization previously existed for
OWPuzzs. In this paper, we establish the first complete characterization of
OWPuzzs based on the hardness of a well-studied learning model: distribution
learning. Specifically, we prove that OWPuzzs exist if and only if proper
quantum distribution learning is hard on average. A natural question that
follows is whether the worst-case hardness of proper quantum distribution
learning can be derived from $PP \neq BQP$. If so, and a worst-case to
average-case hardness reduction is achieved, it would imply OWPuzzs solely from
$PP \neq BQP$. However, we show that this would be extremely difficult: if
worst-case hardness is PP-hard (in a black-box reduction), then $SampBQP \neq
SampBPP$ follows from the infiniteness of the polynomial hierarchy. Despite
that, we show that $PP \neq BQP$ is equivalent to another standard notion of
hardness of learning: agnostic. We prove that $PP \neq BQP$ if and only if
agnostic quantum distribution learning with respect to KL divergence is hard.
As a byproduct, we show that hardness of agnostic quantum distribution learning
with respect to statistical distance against $PPT^{\Sigma_3^P}$ learners
implies $SampBQP \neq SampBPP$.

Motivation: 探索在室温条件下实现超辐射回波的可能性，为量子传感等应用提供新途径。

Method: 结合激光照射和微波Hahn回波序列，通过微波驱动脉冲和自由演化在NV自旋子系综中形成相位光栅，并通过与微波腔的集体耦合实现多次重相位化。

Conclusion: 该方法为量子传感等应用提供了潜在的新工具，未来可通过动态解耦进一步优化性能。

Abstract: In this Letter, we propose that superradiant echoes can be achieved at room
temperature by applying a laser illumination and a microwave Hahn echo sequence
to a diamond with a high concentration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers placed
in a dielectric microwave cavity. We identify that the combined action of two
microwave driving pulses and a free evolution imprints a phase grating among NV
spin sub-ensembles in frequency space, and multiple re-phasing of the grated
spin sub-ensembles leads to multiple superradiant echoes through a collective
coupling with the cavity. Furthermore, we show that the superradiant echoes can
be actively tailored with the microwave pulses and the laser illumination by
modifying the grating parameters, and the multiple re-phasing dynamics is
analogous to the one leading to superradiant beats in optical clock system. In
the future, the spin sub-ensembles grating and the resulting echoes can be
further optimized with dynamical decoupling, which might pave the way for
applications in quantum sensing.

Motivation: 研究量子计算中滤波技术的性能，特别是QPE算法的滤波器在抑制Gibbs现象和查询效率方面的表现。

Method: 使用矩形、正弦和Kaiser窗口函数进行QPE滤波，并与QETU方法比较查询效率；提出两步算法用于低能谱模拟。

Result: Kaiser窗口滤波器的查询效率与优化相位角的QETU相当；两步算法成功应用于MnO的态密度计算。

Conclusion: QPE滤波在特定窗口函数下表现优异，两步算法为低能谱模拟提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Filtering is an important technique in quantum computing used for isolating
or enhancing some specific states of quantum many-body systems. In this paper,
we analyze the performance of filters based on the quantum phase estimation
(QPE) algorithm, in which filtering removes states associated with bitstrings
in the ancilla register above a given threshold. We show that when the
conventional rectangular window function is used for the QPE input state, the
resulting filter function exhibits an oscillating behavior known as the Gibbs
phenomenon. We also show that in the case of the sine and Kaiser windows, this
phenomenon is suppressed. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations to
compare the number of necessary queries to the Hamiltonian time evolution
operation of for the QPE-based filtering algorithm and the quantum eigenvalue
transformation of unitary matrices with real polynomials (QETU). We find that
the number of queries required for Kaiser window-based filtering is comparable
to that for QETU with optimized phase angles. As an application of the
QPE-based filter, we also study a two-step algorithm for low-energy spectral
simulations, composed of a coarse grid for filtering and a fine grid for
obtaining final high-resolution spectra. As a benchmark of the proposed scheme
for realistic continuous spectra, we present the density-of-states (DOS)
calculation of antiferromagnetic type-II MnO in a one-particle approximation.

Method: 将Bloch球上的运动映射到经典坐标系，通过稳定性矩阵元素的消失解释CPs的聚焦效果。

Result: 揭示了CPs在Bloch球上不同方向的聚焦特性，并分析了其对集合宽度的影响。

Conclusion: 通过经典力学方法为CPs的鲁棒性提供了新视角，并以Levitt的CP为例验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Composite Pulses (CPs) are widely used in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR),
optical spectroscopy, optimal control experiments and quantum computing to
manipulate systems that are well-described by a two-level Hamiltonian. A
careful design of these pulses can allow the refocusing of an ensemble at a
desired state, even if the ensemble experiences imperfections in the magnitude
of the external field or resonance offsets. Since the introduction of CPs,
several theoretical justifications for their robustness have been suggested. In
this work, we suggest another justification based on the classical mechanical
concept of a stability matrix. The motion on the Bloch Sphere is mapped to a
canonical system of coordinates and the focusing of an ensemble corresponds to
caustics, or the vanishing of an appropriate stability matrix element in the
canonical coordinates. Our approach highlights the directionality of the
refocusing of the ensemble on the Bloch Sphere, revealing how different
ensembles refocus along different directions. The approach also clarifies when
CPs can induce a change in the width of the ensemble as opposed to simply a
rotation of the axes. As a case study, we investigate the $90(x)180(y)90(x)$ CP
introduced by Levitt, where the approach provides a new perspective into why
this CP is effective.

Abstract: Portable quantum technologies require robust, lightweight apparatus with
superior performance. For techniques dependent upon high-vacuum environments,
such as atom interferometers and atomic clocks, 3D-printing enables new avenues
to tailor in-vacuum gas propagation dynamics. We demonstrate intricate,
fine-scale surface patterning of 3D-printed vacuum components to increase the
rate at which gas particles collide with the surface. By applying a
non-evaporable getter coating for use as a surface pump, we show that the
patterned surface pumps gas particles 3.8 times faster than an equivalent flat
areas. These patterns can be directly integrated into additively manufactured
components, enabling application in close proximity to key experimental regions
and contributing to overall mass-reduction. We develop numerical simulations
that show good agreement with this result and predict up to a ten-fold increase
in pumping rate, for realistic surface structures. Our work has direct
applications in enabling passively-pumped portable quantum technologies, but
also establishes 3D-printing as a powerful technique for the creation of
optimized surface patterning to provide enhanced control over high-vacuum gas
dynamics for a broad range of applications.

Abstract: The next generation of telecommunication networks will rely on the
transmission of complex quantum states to enable secure and transformative
information processing, utilizing entanglement and superposition. Cluster
states - multipartite entangled states that retain entanglement under local
measurements - are a vital resource for quantum networking applications such as
blind photonic quantum computing, quantum state teleportation and all-photonic
quantum repeaters. However, the transmission of cluster states over optical
fiber has remained elusive with previous approaches. Here, we demonstrate the
first transmission of a four-qubit cluster state over 25 km of single-mode
fiber by using a two-photon multi-level time-bin encoding. We directly generate
the state by exploiting coherent control of a parametric generation process,
rendering a resource-intensive controlled-phase gate obsolete. To enable
efficient and reconfigurable projective measurements on the multi-level
time-bin encoded state, we introduce chirped-pulse modulation and implement the
first time-bin beam splitter, allowing us to certify genuine multipartite
entanglement and to demonstrate one-way computing operations. Our approach
enables the transmission of complex quantum states over long-distance fibers,
permitting the implementation of multipartite protocols and laying the
foundation for large-scale quantum resource networks.

Abstract: Time crystals constitute a novel phase of matter defined by the spontaneous
breaking of time-translation symmetry. We present a scheme for realizing a
continuous-time crystal using the vibrational phonon mode of a trapped-ion
system. By coupling two addressable standing-wave lasers to individual ions via
adiabatic elimination, we generate a nonlinear phonon mode with controllable
linear gain ($g$) and nonlinear damping ($\kappa$). This scheme enables stable
dissipative dynamics over timescales significantly longer than the oscillation
period, leading to the emergence of time-translation symmetry breaking - a time
crystal - under specific conditions. Furthermore, we analyze the experimental
feasibility and numerically demonstrate this phonon time crystal using
experimentally feasible parameters. These results provide a practical scheme
for observing a time crystal in a nonlinear phonon mode, which will advance
research into time crystals.

Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics,
profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we
extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic
framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the
system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic
constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical
probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body
classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive
quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations,
presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results
are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible
experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the
statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information
dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum
technologies.

Abstract: We present an exact analytical solution of the Hu-Paz-Zhang master equation
in a precise Markovian limit for a system of two harmonically coupled harmonic
oscillators interacting with a common thermal bath of harmonic oscillators. The
thermal bath is initially considered to be at arbitrary temperatures and
characterized by an Ohmic Lorentz-Drude spectral density. In the examined
system, couplings between the two harmonic oscillators and the environment
ensure a complete decoupling of the center-of-mass and relative degrees of
freedom, resulting in undamped dynamics in the relative coordinate. The exact
time evolution is used to analyze the system's entanglement dynamics,
quantified through logarithmic negativity and quantum mutual information, while
ensuring the positivity of the density operator to confirm the physical
validity of the results. We demonstrate that, under certain parameter regimes
and initial conditions, the asymptotic dynamics can give rise to periodic
entanglement-disentanglement behavior. Furthermore, numerical simulations
reveal that for negative values of the direct coupling between the oscillators,
which are sufficiently close to a critical lower bound beyond which the system
becomes unstable, the system can maintain entanglement across a broad
temperature range and for arbitrarily long durations.

Abstract: A magnetic field enables the interconversion of photons and gravitons, yet
the process is usually analysed only at the level of classical wave equations.
We revisit photon-graviton conversion in a quantum field theoretic framework,
allowing us to track the evolution of arbitrary quantum states. Treating the
photons as squeezed coherent states and the gravitons as the squeezed vacuum
expected for primordial gravitational waves, we derive analytic expressions for
the conversion probability and show that it can be significantly enhanced
compared to the conventional estimate. We further demonstrate that the
conversion both swaps preexisting entanglement and generates genuinely new
entanglement between the electromagnetic and gravitational sectors, which is
impossible in any classical description. Detecting such nonclassical
correlations would constitute compelling evidence for the quantization of
gravity and offers a novel pathway toward graviton detection.

Abstract: Multiphoton entangled states are a key resource for quantum networks and
measurement-based quantum computation. Scalable protocols for generating such
states using solid-state spin-photon interfaces have recently emerged, but
practical implementations have so far relied on emitters operating at short
wavelengths, incompatible with low-loss fibre transmission. Here, we take a key
step towards the generation of telecom wavelength multi-qubit entangled states
using an InAs/InP quantum dot. After establishing that all essential criteria
for generating cluster states using a ground state spin as the entangler are
satisfied, we implement a scalable protocol to entangle the resident spin with
sequentially emitted photons directly in the telecom C-band. We demonstrate a
two-qubit (spin-photon) entanglement fidelity of $59.5\pm 8.7\%$ and a lower
bound of three-qubit (spin-photon-photon) entanglement fidelity of $52.7\pm
11.4\%$. Our results close the performance gap between short-wavelength quantum
dot systems and the existing telecom infrastructure, establishing a route
towards practical large photonic cluster states for fibre-based quantum network
applications.

Abstract: Scaling beyond individual quantum devices via distributed quantum computing
relies critically on high-fidelity quantum state transfers between devices, yet
the quantum interconnects needed for this are currently unavailable or expected
to be significantly noisy. These limitations can be bypassed by simulating
ideal state transfer using quasiprobability decompositions (QPDs). Wire
cutting, for instance, allows this even without quantum interconnects.
Nevertheless, QPD methods face drawbacks, requiring sampling from multiple
circuit variants and incurring substantial sampling overhead. While prior
theoretical work showed that incorporating noisy interconnects within QPD
protocols could reduce sampling overhead relative to interconnect quality, a
practical implementation for realistic conditions was lacking. Addressing this
gap, this work presents a generalized and practical QPD for state transfer
simulation using noisy interconnects to reduce sampling overhead. The QPD
incorporates a single tunable parameter for straightforward calibration to any
utilized interconnect. To lower practical costs, the work also explores
reducing the number of distinct circuit variants required by the QPD.
Experimental validation on contemporary quantum devices confirms the proposed
QPD's practical feasibility and expected sampling overhead reduction under
realistic noise. Notably, the results show higher effective state transfer
fidelity than direct transfer over the underlying noisy interconnect.

Abstract: Combining quantum computing techniques in the form of amplitude amplification
with classical reinforcement learning has led to the so-called "hybrid agent
for quantum-accessible reinforcement learning", which achieves a quadratic
speedup in sample complexity for certain learning problems. So far, this hybrid
agent has only been applied to stationary learning problems, that is, learning
problems without any time dependency within components of the Markov decision
process. In this work, we investigate the applicability of the hybrid agent to
dynamic RL environments. To this end, we enhance the hybrid agent by
introducing a dissipation mechanism and, with the resulting learning agent,
perform an empirical comparison with a classical RL agent in an RL environment
with a time-dependent reward function. Our findings suggest that the modified
hybrid agent can adapt its behavior to changes in the environment quickly,
leading to a higher average success probability compared to its classical
counterpart.

Abstract: Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver
(VQE) show promise for quantum simulations on near-term quantum devices, but
are often limited by complex objective functions and expensive optimization
procedures. Here, we propose Flow-VQE, a generative framework leveraging
conditional normalizing flows with parameterized quantum circuits to
efficiently generate high-quality variational parameters. By embedding a
generative model into the VQE optimization loop through preference-based
training, Flow-VQE enables quantum gradient-free optimization and offers a
systematic approach for parameter transfer, accelerating convergence across
related problems through warm-started optimization. We compare Flow-VQE to a
number of standard benchmarks through numerical simulations on molecular
systems, including hydrogen chains, water, ammonia, and benzene. We find that
Flow-VQE outperforms baseline optimization algorithms, achieving computational
accuracy with fewer circuit evaluations (improvements range from modest to more
than two orders of magnitude) and, when used to warm-start the optimization of
new systems, accelerates subsequent fine-tuning by up to 50-fold compared with
Hartree--Fock initialization. Therefore, we believe Flow-VQE can become a
pragmatic and versatile paradigm for leveraging generative modeling to reduce
the costs of variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: The analysed in this paper new class of $s$-tight IC measurements contains
both morphophoric measurements, preserving the geometry of the states space,
and tight IC measurements, introduced nearly 20 years ago by Scott in the
quantum case as optimal for the task of linear quantum tomography. By looking
at the mathematical side of these classes we discover their common feature,
which is also preserved in the broader class of $s$-tight IC measurements: a
particularly elegant form of the formula that can be seen as the generalised
form of the Urgleichung known from the QBist approach to quantum theory. In
particular, the tight IC measurements are identified as the ones for which this
generalised Urgleichung takes an exceptionally simple form.

Abstract: Hamiltonian quantum gates controlled by classical electromagnetic fields form
the basis of any realistic model of quantum computers. In this letter, we
derive a lower bound on the field energy required to implement such gates and
relate this energy to the expected gate error. We study the entangleability
(ability to entangle qubits) of Hamiltonians and highlight how this feature of
quantum gates can provide a means for more energetically efficient computation.
Ultimately, we show that a universal quantum computer can be realized with
vanishingly low energetic requirements but at the expense of arbitrarily large
complexity.

Abstract: Braiding has attracted significant attention in physics because of its
important role in describing the fundamental exchange of particles. Infusing
the braiding with topological protection will make it robust against
imperfections and perturbations, but such topological braiding is believed to
be possible only in interacting quantum systems, e.g., topological
superconductors. Here, we propose and demonstrate a new strategy of topological
braiding that emerges from non-Abelian topological insulators, a class of
recently discovered multi-band topological phase. We unveil a mathematical
connection between braiding and non-Abelian quaternion invariants, by which
Bloch eigenmodes under parallel transport produce braid sequences protected by
the non-Abelian band topology. The braiding is also associated with geometric
phases quantized over half the Brillouin zone. This new type of non-Abelian
topological braiding is experimentally realized in acoustic systems with
periodic synthetic dimensions. The results show that the principle discovered
here is a new strategy towards topological braiding and can be extended for
other types of classical waves and non-interacting quantum systems.

Abstract: Topological protection offers a robust solution to the challenges of noise
and loss in physical systems. By integrating topological physics into optics,
loading and encoding quantum states into topological invariants can provide
resilience to information systems in the face of environmental disruptions.
Here, we demonstrate on-chip loading and entanglement-assisted transfer of
photon topology, where the topological structure is coherently encoded in a
single-photon spin-textured quantum state, which can be transferred, through
entanglement distribution, into a non-local quantum-correlated topology shared
between two entangled photons. Throughout the transfer process, the topology
remains protected against substantial background noise as well as isotropic and
anisotropic disturbances, while quantum correlations persist. Our framework for
loading and transferring topology is compatible with quantum teleportation when
ancillary photons are introduced, thereby promising the development of
distributed quantum systems with inherently secure and protected information
channels. This approach serves as a step toward building robust quantum
interconnects and advancing distributed quantum information technology mediated
by topology.

Abstract: The study of out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics remains one of the
most exciting research frontiers of physics, standing at the crossroads of our
understanding of complex quantum phenomena and the realization of quantum
advantage. Quantum algorithms for the dynamics of quantum systems typically
require deep quantum circuits whose accuracy is compromised by noise and
imperfections in near-term hardware. Thus, reducing the depth of such quantum
circuits to shallower ones while retaining high accuracy is critical for
quantum simulation. Variational quantum compilation methods offer a promising
path forward, yet a core difficulty persists: ensuring that a variational
ansatz $V$ faithfully approximates a target unitary $U$. Here we leverage Pauli
propagation techniques to develop a strategy for compressing circuits that
implement the dynamics of large two-dimensional (2D) quantum systems and
beyond. As a concrete demonstration, we compress the dynamics of systems up to
$30 \times 30$ qubits and achieve accuracies that surpass standard
Trotterization methods by orders of magnitude at identical circuit depths. To
experimentally validate our approach, we execute the compiled ansatz on
Quantinuum's H1 quantum processor and observe that it tracks the system's
dynamics with significantly higher fidelity than Trotterized circuits without
optimization. Our circuit compression scheme brings us one step closer to a
practical quantum advantage by allowing longer simulation times at reduced
quantum resources and unlocks the exploration of large families of
hardware-friendly ans\"atze.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索量子纠缠和硬件噪声如何为GAN提供结构化归纳偏置，以增强生成模型性能。

Method: 将标准高斯潜在先验替换为基于16量子比特电路的量子相关先验，并集成到WGAN、SNGAN和BigGAN中。

Result: 量子相关先验显著降低了FID分数，硬件噪声进一步提升了性能，最高降低17%。

Conclusion: 量子噪声和纠缠可作为GAN的结构化偏置，为量子信息与机器学习的结合提供了新途径。

Abstract: We propose a novel approach to generative adversarial networks (GANs) in
which the standard i.i.d. Gaussian latent prior is replaced or hybridized with
a quantum-correlated prior derived from measurements of a 16-qubit entangling
circuit. Each latent sample is generated by grouping repeated shots per qubit
into a binary fraction, applying the inverse Gaussian CDF to obtain a
16-dimensional Gaussian vector whose joint copula reflects genuine quantum
entanglement, and then projecting into the high-dimensional space via a fixed
random matrix. By pre-sampling tens of millions of bitstrings, either from a
noiseless simulator or from IBM hardware, we build large pools of independent
but internally quantum-correlated latents. We integrate this prior into three
representative architectures (WGAN, SNGAN, BigGAN) on CIFAR-10, making no
changes to the neural network structure or training hyperparameters. The hybrid
latent representations incorporating hardware-derived noise consistently lower
the FID relative to both the classical baseline and the simulator variant,
especially when the quantum component constitutes a substantial fraction of the
prior. In addition, we execute on the QPU in parallel to not only save
computing time but also further decrease the FID up to 17% in BigGAN. These
results indicate that intrinsic quantum randomness and device-specific
imperfections can provide a structured inductive bias that enhances GAN
performance. Our work demonstrates a practical pipeline for leveraging noisy
quantum hardware to enrich deep-generative modeling, opening a new interface
between quantum information and machine learning. All code and data are

Method: 分析五种常见电子结构方法（如Tequila和ffsim中的方法），并与Qiskit Circuit Cutting插件结合，评估其通过局部操作切割的可行性。

Result: 多数电子结构方法无法通过局部操作高效并行化，需开发新方法以适应分布式量子计算框架。

Conclusion: 当前电子结构方法在分布式量子计算中效率不足，需进一步研究新方法以实现其实际应用。

Abstract: To move towards the utility era of quantum computing, many corporations have
posed distributed quantum computing (DQC) as a framework for scaling the
current generation of devices for practical applications. One of these
applications is quantum chemistry, also known as electronic structure theory,
which has been poised as a "killer application" of quantum computing, To this
end, we analyze five electronic structure methods, found in common packages
such as Tequila and ffsim, which can be easily interfaced with the Qiskit
Circuit Cutting addon. Herein, we provide insights into cutting these
algorithms using local operations (LO) to determine their aptitude for
distribution. The key findings of our work are that many of these algorithms
cannot be efficiently parallelized using LO, and new methods must be developed
to apply electronic structure theory within a DQC framework.

Abstract: Feedback control in open quantum dynamics is crucial for the advancement of
various coherent platforms. For a proper theoretical description, however, most
feedback schemes rely on stochastic trajectories, which require significant
statistical sampling and lack analytical insight. Currently, only a handful of
deterministic feedback master equations exist in the literature. In this letter
we derive a set of deterministic equations for describing feedback schemes
based on generic causal signals. Our formulation is phrased in terms of
sequentially applied quantum instruments, and is therefore extremely general,
recovering various known results in the literature as particular cases. We then
specialize this result to the case of quantum jumps and derive a new
deterministic equation that allows for feedback based on the channel of the
last jump, as well as the time since the last jump occurred. The strength of
this formalism is illustrated with a detailed study of population inversion of
a qubit using coherent drive and feedback, where our formalism allows all
calculations to be performed analytically.
