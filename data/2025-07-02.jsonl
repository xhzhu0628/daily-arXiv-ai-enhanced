This work\nintroduces a segmentation-based regression method tailored to quantum neural\nnetworks (QNNs), where real-valued outputs are encoded as base-b digit\nsequences and inferred through greedy digitwise optimization. By casting the\nregression task as a constrained combinatorial problem over a structured digit\nlattice, the method replaces continuous inference with interpretable and\ntractable updates. A hybrid quantum-classical architecture is employed: quantum\ncircuits generate candidate digits through projective measurement, while\nclassical forward models evaluate these candidates based on task-specific error\nfunctionals. We formalize the algorithm from first principles, derive\nconvergence and complexity bounds, and demonstrate its effectiveness on inverse\nproblems involving PDE-constrained models. The resulting framework provides a\nrobust, high-precision interface between quantum outputs and continuous\nscientific inference."}

Determining whether or not a physical system\nwill thermalize from an initial state has been a key question in condensed\nmatter physics. Closely related questions are determining whether observables\nin these systems relax to stationary values, and what those values are. Using\ntools from computational complexity theory, we demonstrate that given a\nHamiltonian on a finite-sized system, determining whether or not it thermalizes\nor relaxes to a given stationary value is computationally intractable, even for\na quantum computer. In particular, we show that the problem of determining\nwhether an observable of a finite-sized quantum system relaxes to a given value\nis PSPACE-complete, and so no efficient algorithm for determining the value is\nexpected to exist. Further, we show the existence of Hamiltonians for which the\nproblem of determining whether the system thermalizes is contained in PSPACE\nand is PSPACE-hard under quantum polynomial time reductions. We also present\nevidence that determining thermalization is PSPACE-hard under classical\npolynomial time reductions and state a physically reasonable conjecture under\nwhich it is PSPACE-complete. In light of recent results demonstrating\nundecidability of thermalization in the thermodynamic limit, our work shows\nthat the intractability of the problem is due to inherent difficulties in\nmany-body physics rather than particularities of infinite systems."}

Our results indicate that a coupled\noscillator system can exhibit significant quantum coherence in the ultrastrong\nand deep strong coupling regimes. In the ground state, the photon-mode and the\nmatter-mode coherences are equal. The larger coherences that encompass the\nphoton mode, the matter mode, and the overall system are achieved at lower\noptical frequencies and with increased coupling strengths.

The corresponding quantum dynamic programming\nalgorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart,\nwhile achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or\noptimization) problem $\\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\\mathcal P$, such a\nspeedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\\delta$ of the\ndependency digraph $G_{\\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive\nformulation of $\\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of\n$\\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to\nthose on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to\nsolve the considered problems in $\\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\\mathcal{P}}(I))|\n\\sqrt{\\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the\nBellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex\nto all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that\nruns in $\\tilde{O}(n\\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical\nupper bound when $m \\in \\Omega(n^{1.4})$."}

While quantum approaches reduce the\nsystem-size scaling, existing methods rely on heuristic techniques with\nmeasurement precision or success probability that deteriorates as evolution\ntime increases. We present a quantum algorithm that prepares normalized\nimaginary-time evolved states using an adaptive normalization factor to\nmaintain stable success probability over large imaginary times. Our algorithm\napproximates the target state to polynomially small errors in inverse imaginary\ntime using polynomially many elementary quantum gates and a single ancilla\nqubit, achieving success probability close to one. When the initial state has\nreasonable overlap with the ground state, this algorithm also achieves\npolynomial resource complexity in the system size. We extend this approach to\nground-state preparation and ground-state energy estimation, achieving reduced\ncircuit depth compared to existing methods. Numerical experiments validate our\ntheoretical results for evolution time up to 50, demonstrating the algorithm's\neffectiveness for long-time evolution and its potential applications for early\nfault-tolerant quantum computing."}

In this\nwork, we implement a nonperturbative approach to quantify how static energetic\ndisorder renormalizes polariton group velocity in strongly coupled\nmicrocavities. The method requires no exact diagonalization or master equation\npropagation, and depends only on measurable parameters: the mean exciton energy\nand its variance, the microcavity dispersion, and the Rabi splitting. Using\nparameters corresponding to recently probed organic microcavities, we show that\nexciton inhomogeneous broadening slows both lower and upper polaritons,\nparticularly when the mean exciton energy fluctuation approaches the collective\nlight-matter coupling strength. A detailed discussion and interpretation of\nthese results is provided using perturbation theory in the limit of weak\nresonance scattering. Overall, our results support the view that exciton-phonon\ninteractions likely dominate the recent experimental observations of polariton\nslowdown in disordered media."}

We engineer the periodic atomic array with\ntwo distinct nearest-neighbor spacings, i.e., $d$=$\\lambda_0/2$ and\n$d$=$\\lambda_0/4$, which correspond to Bragg and anti-Bragg scattering\nconditions, respectively. The system consists of eight atoms arranged to\nmaintain these specific interatomic distances. By controlling atomic\nfrequencies, we modify Bragg and anti-Bragg superatoms, resulting in distinctly\ndifferent quantum optical phenomena, such as collectively induced transparency\nand a broad photonic bandgap.

We illustrate this\napproach using two examples and show numerically that, within a sufficiently\ngeneral circuit family, two simple interest functions based on (i)\nclassifiability of evolved states and (ii) spectral properties of the unitary\ncircuit, are maximized by discrete time crystals (DTCs) and dual-unitary\ncircuits, respectively.
