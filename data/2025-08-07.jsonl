In recent years, Graph Neural Networks\n(GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach, but their training methodologies\nare not yet well-established. It is generally expected that transferring\ntheoretical knowledge from classical algorithms like Minimum Weight Perfect\nMatching (MWPM) to GNNs, a technique known as knowledge distillation, can\neffectively improve performance. In this work, we test this hypothesis by\nrigorously comparing two models based on a Graph Attention Network (GAT)\narchitecture that incorporates temporal information as node features. The first\nis a purely data-driven model (baseline) trained only on ground-truth labels,\nwhile the second incorporates a knowledge distillation loss based on the\ntheoretical error probabilities from MWPM. Using public experimental data from\nGoogle, our evaluation reveals that while the final test accuracy of the\nknowledge distillation model was nearly identical to the baseline, its training\nloss converged more slowly, and the training time increased by a factor of\napproximately five.

A promising avenue of inquiry in the\nmeanwhile is to seek practical advantages through hybrid quantum-classical\nalgorithms, which combine conventional neural networks with variational quantum\ncircuits (VQCs) running on today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\nhardware. Such hybrids are well suited to NISQ hardware. The classical\nprocessor performs the bulk of the computation, while the quantum processor\nexecutes targeted sub-tasks that supply additional non-linearity and\nexpressivity. Here, we benchmark a purely classical E(3)-equivariant\nmessage-passing machine learning potential (MLP) against a hybrid\nquantum-classical MLP for predicting density functional theory (DFT) properties\nof liquid silicon. In our hybrid architecture, every readout in the\nmessage-passing layers is replaced by a VQC. Molecular dynamics simulations\ndriven by the HQC-MLP reveal that an accurate reproduction of high-temperature\nstructural and thermodynamic properties is achieved with VQCs.
