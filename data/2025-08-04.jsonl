This\ndeformation acts as a conceptual lens, warping the local structure of quantum\nstates to produce oscillations far exceeding the global Fourier bandwidth.

In a distinct research direction,\nthe concept of approximate unitary designs have led to efficient constructions\nof unitaries that look random according to forward-in-time protocols. Bridging\nthese two concepts, in this work we study the emergence of freeness from a\nrandom matrix product unitary (RMPU) ensemble. We prove that, with only\npolynomial bond dimension, these unitaries reproduce Haar values of\nhigher-order OTOCs for local, finite-trace observables -- precisely the\nobservables that lead to thermal correlations in chaotic many-body systems\naccording to the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. The RMPU ensemble\nprovably forms a unitary design, but, we argue, this does not account for\naverage OTOC behavior and therefore the emergence of freeness. We further\ncompute the ensemble's frame potential exactly to second order, showing\nconvergence to Haar values also with polynomial deviations, indicating that\nfreeness is also reached on-average for global observables. On the other hand,\nto reproduce the Haar-like OTOC value for local, traceless observables, the\nconsidered ensemble requires volume-law operator entanglement.

We\ndemonstrate that coherent, fast-time modulation of the driving laser\nfrequency-on time scales longer than the mechanical decoherence time-allows for\nadiabatic elimination of the mechanical mode, resulting in strong parametric\namplification of quantum vacuum fluctuations of the intracavity field. This\nmechanism, known as the parametric dynamical Casimir effect (parametric-DCE),\nleads to the generation of Casimir photons. In the dispersive RDR, we find that\nthe total system Hamiltonian-including the DCE term-is intrinsically modified\nby a generalized optomechanical Kerr-type nonlinearity. This nonlinearity not\nonly saturates the mean number of radiated Casimir photons on short time\nscales, even without dissipation, but also induces oscillatory behavior in\ntheir dynamics and quantum characteristics. Remarkably, the presence of the\nKerr nonlinearity causes the generated DCE photons to exhibit nonclassical\nfeatures, including sub-Poissonian statistics, negative Wigner function and\nquadrature squeezing which can be controlled by adjusting the system\nparameters. The proposed nonclassical microwave radiation source possesses the\npotential to be applied in quantum information processing, quantum computing as\nwell as microwave quantum sensing."}
