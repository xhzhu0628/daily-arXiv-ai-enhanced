The choice of data encoding\nscheme dictates the degree of redundancy for a Fourier coefficient. We find\nthat the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients' gradients during training\nstrongly correlates with the coefficients' redundancy. We then further\ndemonstrate this empirically with three different encoding schemes.\nAdditionally, we demonstrate that PQCs with greater redundancy exhibit\nincreased robustness to random perturbations in their parameters at the\ncorresponding frequencies. We investigate how design choices affect the ability\nof PQCs to learn Fourier sums, focusing on parameter initialization scale and\nentanglement structure, finding large initializations and low-entanglement\nschemes tend to slow convergence."}

Traditionally, quantum\nFisher information (QFI) has been the key tool in determining precision limits\nwithin Hermitian quantum systems. However, recent research has expanded to\nnon-Hermitian systems exhibiting real spectra. This study investigates various\ninterpretations of non-Hermitian quantum dynamics such as the normalization and\nmetric approaches. We demonstrate that owing to distinct types of dynamic\nbehaviour, QFI expressions vary significantly depending on the formalism. In\nparticular, the normalization formalism overestimates the enhancement and/or\nrevivals in QFI, effectively post-selecting the most optimistic case of the\nevolution, which may give an overly favourable impression of the sensitivity\nand accuracy of quantum measurements. The metric-based interpretation maintains\nconsistency with a Hermitian-like structure, offering a more stable and\nconservative assessment of measurement precision. This approach provides a more\nnatural representation of the system's evolution, enabling a more accurate\nassessment of quantum measurement sensitivity without the need for\npost-selection. We support our claims by focussing on QFI dynamics for a qubit\nsystem, while advocating the metric interpretation as a more reliable guide for\nquantum metrology despite presenting both approaches as valid and complementary\nways of understanding non-Hermitian dynamics."}

Shadow process tomography (SPT) utilizes the Choi isomorphism to map\nQPT to shadow state tomography (SST), significantly reducing the sample\ncomplexity for extracting information from quantum processes. However, SPT\nrelies on random unitary operators and complicates the determination of the\noptimal unitary operator that minimizes the shadow norm, which is the key\nfactor influencing the sample complexity. In this work, we propose a\ngeneralized SPT framework that minimizes the shadow norm by replacing unitary\noperators with generalized measurements (POVMs).
