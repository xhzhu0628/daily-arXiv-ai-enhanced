Abstract: We give an introduction to the theory of quantum error correction using
stabilizer codes that is geared towards the working computer scientists and
mathematicians with an interest in exploring this area. To this end, we begin
with an introduction to basic quantum computation for the uninitiated. We then
construct several examples of simple error correcting codes without reference
to the underlying mathematical formalism in order to develop the readers
intuition for the structure of a generic code. With this in hand, we then
discuss the more general theory of stabilizer codes and provide the necessary
level of mathematical detail for the non-mathematician. Finally, we give a
brief look at the elegant homological algebra formulation for topological
codes. As a bonus, we give implementations of the codes we mention using
OpenQASM, and we address the more recent approaches to decoding using neural
networks. We do not attempt to give a complete overview of the entire field,
but provide the reader with the level of detail needed to continue in this
direction.

Abstract: The experimental verification of multipartite entangled states is essential
for advancing quantum information processing. Entanglement witnesses (EWs)
provide a widely used and experimentally accessible approach for detecting
genuinely multipartite entangled states. In this work, we theoretically derive
the entanglement witness for the four-qubit Dicke state and experimentally
evaluate it on two distinct IBM 127-qubit Quantum Processing Units (QPUs),
namely ibm\_sherbrook and ibm\_brisbane. A negative expectation value of the
witness operator serves as a sufficient condition for confirming genuine
multipartite entanglement. We report the maximum (negative) values of the
witness achieved on these QPUs as $-0.178 \pm 0.009$ and $-0.169 \pm 0.002$,
corresponding to two different state preparation protocols. Additionally, we
theoretically investigate the effect of various noise channels on the genuine
entanglement of a four-qubit Dicke state using the Qiskit Aer simulator. We
show the behavior of the EW constructed under the assumption of Markovian and
non-Markovian amplitude damping and depolarizing noises, bit-phase flip noise,
and readout errors. We also investigate the effect of varying thermal
relaxation time on the EW, depicting a bound on the $T_1$ time required for
successful generation of a Dicke State on a superconducting QPU.

### [3] [Magic phase transitions in monitored gaussian fermions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07179)

Conclusion: 魔幻态诊断揭示了监测多体动力学中隐藏的特征，突显其在复杂性转变研究中的优势。

Abstract: Monitored quantum systems, where unitary dynamics compete with continuous
measurements, exhibit dynamical transitions as the measurement rate is varied.
These reflect abrupt changes in the structure of the evolving wavefunction,
captured by complementary complexity diagnostics that include and go beyond
entanglement aspects. Here, we investigate how monitoring affects magic state
resources, the nonstabilizerness, of Gaussian fermionic systems. Using scalable
Majorana sampling techniques, we track the evolution of stabilizer R\'enyi
entropies in large systems under projective measurements. While the leading
extensive (volume-law) scaling of magic remains robust across all measurement
rates, we uncover a sharp transition in the subleading logarithmic corrections.
This measurement-induced complexity transition, invisible to standard
entanglement probes, highlights the power of magic-based diagnostics in
revealing hidden features of monitored many-body dynamics.

### [4] [Lindbladian versus Postselected Non-Hermitian Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07187)

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文探讨了非厄米拓扑在开放量子动力学中的表现，特别是Lindbladian超算子的绕数与非厄米哈密顿量的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非厄米拓扑在多体系统中的表现，尤其是在没有后选择的情况下，非厄米皮肤效应是否仍然存在。

Method: 通过定义Lindbladian超算子的绕数，并与后选择的非厄米哈密顿量的绕数进行系统比较。

Result: 证明在无增益（或损耗）时，两种绕数相等（或相反）；在同时存在损耗和增益时，Lindbladian绕数仍可量化且非零。

Conclusion: 后选择会掩盖某些相变现象，而去除后选择可能从拓扑平凡的非厄米动力学中诱导出皮肤效应。

Abstract: The recent topological classification of non-Hermitian `Hamiltonians' is
usually interpreted in terms of pure quantum states that decay or grow with
time. However, many-body systems with loss and gain are typically better
described by mixed-state open quantum dynamics, which only correspond to
pure-state non-Hermitian dynamics upon a postselection of measurement outcomes.
Since postselection becomes exponentially costly with particle number, we here
investigate to what extent the most important example of non-Hermitian topology
can survive without it: the non-Hermitian skin effect and its relationship to a
bulk winding number in one spatial dimension. After defining the winding number
of the Lindbladian superoperator for a quadratic fermion system, we
systematically relate it to the winding number of the associated postselected
non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We prove that the two winding numbers are equal
(opposite) in the absence of gain (loss), and provide a physical explanation
for this relationship. When both loss and gain are present, the Lindbladian
winding number typically remains quantized and non-zero, though it can change
sign at a phase transition separating the loss and gain-dominated regimes. This
transition, which leads to a reversal of the Lindbladian skin effect
localization, is rendered invisible by postselection. We also identify a case
where removing postselection induces a skin effect from otherwise topologically
trivial non-Hermitian dynamics.

Result: 发现能量谱的衰减速率不超过平方反比，解释了矩阵乘积态能量谱不呈指数衰减的现象。

Conclusion: 量子优势问题可简化为哈密顿量本征态的能量和纠缠特性分析。

Abstract: Quantum algorithms for estimating the ground state energy of a quantum system
often operate by preparing a classically accessible quantum state and then
applying quantum phase estimation. Whether this approach yields quantum
advantage hinges on the state's energy spectrum, that is, the sequence of the
state's overlaps with the energy eigenstates of the system Hamiltonian. For any
entanglement-compressed quantum state with minimal expected energy, it is shown
that its energy spectrum decays at most with the inverse-squared energy
eigenvalues. This explains the main empirical finding of Silvester, Carleo, and
White (Physical Review Letters, 2025) that the energy spectra of matrix product
states do not decay exponentially. It also reduces the question of quantum
advantage to the energy and entanglement profile of the Hamiltonian's
eigenstates.

Conclusion: 本文为布尔函数谱的量子算法应用提供了新的理论框架和实用方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we study different cryptographically significant spectra of
Boolean functions, including the Walsh-Hadamard, cross-correlation, and
autocorrelation. The $2^k$-variation by Stanica [IEEE-IT 2016] is considered
here with the formulation for any $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Given this, we present
the most generalized version of the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, which extends the
standard and previously extended versions, thereby encompassing them as special
cases. Additionally, we generalize the Forrelation formulation by introducing
the $m$-Forrelation and propose various quantum algorithms towards its
estimation. In this regard, we explore different strategies in sampling these
newly defined spectra using the proposed $m$-Forrelation algorithms and present
a comparison of their corresponding success probabilities. Finally, we address
the problem related to affine transformations of generalized bent functions and
discuss quantum algorithms in identifying the shifts between two bent (or
negabent) functions with certain modifications, and compare these with existing
results.

### [7] [Kubo-Martin-Schwinger relation for energy eigenstates of SU(2)-symmetric quantum many-body systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07249)

Conclusion: 非阿贝尔对称性可能显著影响热力学行为，为量子物理中的非平衡研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: The fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) is a fundamental result in
statistical mechanics. It stipulates that, if perturbed out of equilibrium, a
system responds at a rate proportional to a thermal-equilibrium property.
Applications range from particle diffusion to electrical-circuit noise. To
prove the FDT, one must prove that common thermal states obey a symmetry
property, the Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) relation. Energy eigenstates of
certain quantum many-body systems were recently proved to obey the KMS
relation. The proof relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH),
which explains how such systems thermalize internally. This KMS relation
contains a finite-size correction that scales as the inverse system size.
Non-Abelian symmetries conflict with the ETH, so a non-Abelian ETH was proposed
recently. Using it, we derive a KMS relation for SU(2)-symmetric quantum
many-body systems' energy eigenstates. The finite-size correction scales as
usual under certain circumstances but can be polynomially larger in others, we
argue. We support the ordinary-scaling result numerically, simulating a
Heisenberg chain of 16-24 qubits. The numerics, limited by computational
capacity, indirectly support the larger correction. This work helps extend into
nonequilibrium physics the effort, recently of interest across quantum physics,
to identify how non-Abelian symmetries may alter conventional thermodynamics.

### [8] [Analytic Rényi Entropy Bounds for Device-Independent Cryptography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07365)

Motivation: 设备无关密码学是最高安全级别的密码学，但其商业化需要更紧的有限尺寸安全证明。

Method: 通过解析求解基于Rényi熵的密钥率优化问题，提出了一种简单方法。

Result: 提供了更紧的有限尺寸密钥率，适用于基于CHSH游戏的协议。

Conclusion: 该方法推动了设备无关密码学向商业化迈进。

Abstract: Device-independent (DI) cryptography represents the highest level of
security, enabling cryptographic primitives to be executed safely on
uncharacterized devices. Moreover, with successful proof-of-concept
demonstrations in randomness expansion, randomness amplification, and quantum
key distribution, the field is steadily advancing toward commercial viability.
Critical to this continued progression is the development of tighter
finite-size security proofs. In this work, we provide a simple method to obtain
tighter finite-size security proofs for protocols based on the CHSH game, which
is the nonlocality test used in all of the proof-of-concept experiments. We
achieve this by analytically solving key-rate optimization problems based on
R\'enyi entropies, providing a simple method to obtain tighter finite-size key
rates.

Abstract: Semiclassical approximations for various representations of a quantum state
are constructed on a single (Lagrangian) surface in phase space, but it is not
available for chaotic systems. An analogous evolution surface underlies
semiclassical representations of the evolution operator, albeit in a doubled
phase space. It is here shown that, corresponding to the Fourier transform on a
unitary operator, represented as a Green function or spectral Wigner function,
a Legendre transform generates a resolvent surface as the classical basis for
semiclassical representations of the resolvent operator in double phase space,
independently of the integrable or chaotic nature of the system. This surface
coincides with derivatives of action functions (or generating functions)
depending on the choice of appropriate coordinates and its growth departs from
the energy shell following trajectories in double phase space. In an initial
study of the resolvent surface based on its caustics, its complex nature is
revealed to be analogous to a multidimensional sponge.
  Resummation of the trace of the resolvent in terms of linear combinations of
periodic orbits, known as pseudo orbits or composite orbits, provides a cutoff
to the semiclassical sum at the Heisenberg time. It is here shown that the
corresponding actions for higher times can be approximately included within
true secondary periodic orbits, in which multiple windings of short periodic
orbits are joined by heteroclinic orbits into larger circuits.

Abstract: Quantum computing proposes a revolutionary paradigm that can radically
transform numerous scientific and industrial application domains. To realize
this promise, these new capabilities need software solutions that are able to
effectively harness its power. However, developers may face significant
challenges when developing and executing quantum software due to the limited
availability of quantum computer hardware, high computational demands of
simulating quantum computers on classical systems, and complicated technology
stack to enable currently available accelerators into development environments.
These limitations make it difficult for the developer to create an efficient
workflow for quantum software development. In this paper, we investigate the
potential of using remote computational capabilities in an efficient manner to
improve the workflow of quantum software developers, by lowering the barrier of
moving between local execution and computationally more efficient remote
hardware and offering speedup in execution with simulator surroundings. The
goal is to allow the development of more complex circuits and to support an
iterative software development approach. In our experiment, with the solution
presented in this paper, we have obtained up to 5 times faster circuit
execution runtime, and enabled qubit ranges from 21 to 29 qubits with a simple
plug-and-play kernel for the Jupyter notebook.

Abstract: Quantum battery has become one of the hot issues at the research frontiers of
quantum physics recently. Charging power, extractable work and wireless
charging over long-distance are three important aspects of interest.
Non-contact electromagnetic interaction provides an important avenue for
wireless charging. In this paper, we design a wireless and remote charging
scheme based on the quantized Hamiltonian of two coupled LC circuits, and focus
on the charging dynamics of a continuous variable quantum battery. It is found
that the quantum entanglement, which is regarded as a significant quantum
resource, is not a prerequisite for charging the battery and extracting useful
work. On the contrary, all of the energy in the battery could be converted into
useful work in the absence of the entanglement for our model. The often
overlooked counter-rotating wave coupling in the interacting Hamiltonian is
helpful for extracting more useful work from the charger. If the coupling
between the battery and the charger is designed to contain both the rotating
and counter-rotating wave couplings, the extractable work can be obtained even
if the charger is prepared in thermal states, while such effect cannot be
achieved in the presence of a rotating or counter-rotating wave coupling alone.
Finally, the effect of the system's parameters on the extractable work is
discussed, which will provide a reference for full use of the thermal state
energy.

Result: 量子算法在特征向量维度和动作空间大小上实现了二次加速。

Conclusion: 量子学徒学习算法在效率上显著优于经典方法，为复杂任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Apprenticeship learning is a method commonly used to train artificial
intelligence systems to perform tasks that are challenging to specify directly
using traditional methods. Based on the work of Abbeel and Ng (ICML'04), we
present a quantum algorithm for apprenticeship learning via inverse
reinforcement learning. As an intermediate step, we give a classical
approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm to demonstrate the speedup
obtained by our quantum algorithm. We prove convergence guarantees on our
classical approximate apprenticeship learning algorithm, which also extends to
our quantum apprenticeship learning algorithm. We also show that, as compared
to its classical counterpart, our quantum algorithm achieves an improvement in
the per-iteration time complexity by a quadratic factor in the dimension of the
feature vectors $k$ and the size of the action space $A$.

Conclusion: α-z相对熵在量子信息处理中具有重要操作意义。

Abstract: In this work, we offer the first operational interpretation of the
$\alpha$-$z$ relative entropies, which were introduced by Jak\v{s}i\'{c} {\it
et al.} \cite{Jaksic2012} and Audenaert and Datta \cite{Audenaert_Datta_2015},
where the $\alpha$ and $z$ parameters are truly independent from each other.
Namely, we show that these relative entropies appear in the conditions for
large-sample or catalytic relative majorization of pairs of flat states and
certain generalizations of them. Additionally, the optimal rate of converting
one such pair into another may be formulated in terms of the $\alpha$-$z$
relative entropies.

### [14] [Simulating sparse SYK model with a randomized algorithm on a trapped-ion quantum computer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07530)

Conclusion: 提出了基于随机化SYK哈密顿量和TETRIS算法的可扩展镜像电路基准，认为其对局部可观测量保真度衰减的估计优于标准镜像电路。

Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model describes a strongly correlated quantum
system that shows a strong signature of quantum chaos. Due to its chaotic
nature, the simulation of real-time dynamics becomes quickly intractable by
means of classical numerics, and thus, quantum simulation is deemed to be an
attractive alternative. Nevertheless, quantum simulations of the SYK model on
noisy quantum processors are severely limited by the complexity of its
Hamiltonian. In this work, we simulate the real-time dynamics of a sparsified
version of the SYK model with 24 Majorana fermions on a trapped-ion quantum
processor. We adopt a randomized quantum algorithm, TETRIS, and develop an
error mitigation technique tailored to the algorithm. Leveraging the hardware's
high-fidelity quantum operations and all-to-all connectivity of the qubits, we
successfully calculate the Loschmidt amplitude for sufficiently long times so
that its decay is observed. Based on the experimental and further numerical
results, we assess the future possibility of larger-scale simulations of the
SYK model by estimating the required quantum resources. Moreover, we present a
scalable mirror-circuit benchmark based on the randomized SYK Hamiltonian and
the TETRIS algorithm, which we argue provides a better estimate of the decay of
fidelity for local observables than standard mirror-circuits.

Abstract: We have recently put forth several schemes of unconventional,
nonlinearly-enabled thermodynamic (TD) devices that can operate in either the
classical or the quantum domain by transforming thermal-state input in multiple
uncorrelated modes into non-gaussian state output in selected modes: a
four-mode Kerr-nonlinear interferometer that acts as a heat engine; two coupled
Kerr-nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometers that act as a phase microscope with
unprecedented phase resolution; and a noise sensor that can distinguish between
unknown nonlinear quantum processes. These schemes reveal the unique merits of
nonlinear TD devices: their ability to act in an autonomous, fully coherent,
dissipationless fashion, unlike their conventional counterparts. Here we
present the opportunities and challenges facing this new paradigm of nonlinear
(NL) quantum and classical TD devices along the following lines: A) Linear
versus nonlinear multimode transformations in TD devices: what are the
principal distinctions between the two types of transformations? B) Classical
versus quantum effects in NL TD devices: what are their main differences? Is
quantumness an advantage or a disadvantage? C) Deterministic methods of
achieving giant nonlinearity at the few-photon level via coherent processes,
including multiatom-bath interactions which can paradoxically yield NL
Hamiltonian effects: their comparison with probabilistic, measurement-based
methods that can achieve similar NL effects in the quantum domain.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 变分量子算法在近量子处理器中具有潜力，但高测量成本、贫瘠高原和复杂优化问题阻碍了其发展。

Conclusion: sVQNHE展示了经典与量子资源协同的潜力，适用于NISQ时代及未来的复杂多体和组合优化问题。

Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms hold great promise for unlocking the power of
near-term quantum processors, yet high measurement costs, barren plateaus, and
challenging optimization landscapes frequently hinder them. Here, we introduce
sVQNHE, a neural-guided variational quantum algorithm that decouples amplitude
and sign learning across classical and quantum modules, respectively. Our
approach employs shallow quantum circuits composed of commuting diagonal gates
to efficiently model quantum phase information, while a classical neural
network learns the amplitude distribution and guides circuit optimization in a
bidirectional feedback loop. This hybrid quantum-classical synergy not only
reduces measurement costs but also achieves high expressivity with limited
quantum resources and improves the convergence rate of the variational
optimization. We demonstrate the advancements brought by sVQNHE through
extensive numerical experiments. For the 6-qubit J1-J2 model, a prototypical
system with a severe sign problem for Monte Carlo-based methods, it reduces the
mean absolute error by 98.9% and suppresses variance by 99.6% relative to a
baseline neural network, while requiring nearly 19x fewer optimization steps
than a standard hardware-efficient VQE. Furthermore, for MaxCut problems on
45-vertex Erdos-Renyi graphs, sVQNHE improves solution quality by 19% and
quantum resource efficiency by 85%. Importantly, this framework is designed to
be scalable and robust against hardware noise and finite-sampling uncertainty,
making it well-suited for both current NISQ processors and future high-quality
quantum computers. Our results highlight a promising path forward for
efficiently tackling complex many-body and combinatorial optimization problems
by fully exploiting the synergy between classical and quantum resources in the
NISQ era and beyond.

Abstract: At the interception between quantum computing and machine learning, Quantum
Reinforcement Learning (QRL) has emerged as a promising research field. Due to
its novelty, a standardized and comprehensive collection for QRL algorithms has
not yet been established. Researchers rely on numerous software stacks for
classical Reinforcement Learning (RL) as well as on various quantum computing
frameworks for the implementation of the quantum subroutines of their QRL
algorithms. Inspired by the CleanRL library for classical RL algorithms, we
present CleanQRL, a library that offers single-script implementations of many
QRL algorithms. Our library provides clear and easy to understand scripts that
researchers can quickly adapt to their own needs. Alongside ray tune for
distributed computing and streamlined hyperparameter tuning, CleanQRL uses
weights&biases to log important metrics, which facilitates benchmarking against
other classical and quantum implementations. The CleanQRL library enables
researchers to easily transition from theoretical considerations to practical
applications.

Conclusion: 提出的SGD算法在在线低秩QST中表现出色，兼具高效性和实用性。

Abstract: We initiate the study of online quantum state tomography (QST), where the
matrix representation of an unknown quantum state is reconstructed by
sequentially performing a batch of measurements and updating the state estimate
using only the measurement statistics from the current round. Motivated by
recent advances in non-convex optimization algorithms for solving low-rank QST,
we propose non-convex mini-batch stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithms
to tackle online QST, which leverage the low-rank structure of the unknown
quantum state and are well-suited for practical applications. Our main
technical contribution is a rigorous convergence analysis of these algorithms.
With proper initialization, we demonstrate that the SGD algorithms for online
low-rank QST achieve linear convergence both in expectation and with high
probability. Our algorithms achieve nearly optimal sample complexity while
remaining highly memory-efficient. In particular, their time complexities are
better than the state-of-the-art non-convex QST algorithms, in terms of the
rank and the logarithm of the dimension of the unknown quantum state.

Abstract: Computing the excitation spectra of quantum many-body systems on noisy
quantum devices is a promising avenue to demonstrate the practical utility of
current quantum processors, especially as we move toward the ``megaquop''
regime. For this task, here we introduce a \textit{tangent-space excitation
ansatz} for quantum circuits, motivated by the quasi-particle picture of
many-body systems and the structural similarity between quantum circuits and
classical tensor networks. Increasing the circuit depth by one layer to
construct the tangent space around the variational optimum of a parametrized
quantum circuit, we show that a large number of low-energy states can be
accurately captured. We demonstrate this ansatz using various models in both
one and two spatial dimensions, including the challenging kagome Heisenberg
antiferromagnet. We further provide evidence that this approach, implementable
using Hadamard test, is stable in the presence of measurement noise and
scalable to large system size.

Abstract: Hybrid solvers for combinatorial optimization problems combine the advantages
of classical and quantum computing to overcome difficult computational
challenges. Although their theoretical performance seems promising, their
practical applicability is challenging due to the lack of a technological stack
that can seamlessly integrate quantum solutions with existing classical
optimization frameworks. We tackle this challenge by introducing the ProvideQ
toolbox, a software tool that enables users to easily adapt and configure
hybrid solvers via Meta-Solver strategies. A Meta-Solver strategy implements
decomposition techniques, which splits problems into classical and quantum
subroutines. The ProvideQ toolbox enables the interactive creation of such
decompositions via a Meta-Solver configuration tool. It combines
well-established classical optimization techniques with quantum circuits that
are seamlessly executable on multiple backends. This paper introduces the
technical details of the ProvideQ toolbox, explains its architecture, and
demonstrates possible applications for several real-world use cases. Our proof
of concept shows that Meta-Solver strategies already enable the application of
quantum subroutines today, however, more sophisticated hardware is required to
make their performance competitive.

TL;DR: VQE通过优化1-RDM提高分子模拟精度，提出两步算法优化能量和1-RDM，显著提升电子性质准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统VQE仅优化能量，1-RDM的可靠性不足，影响分子性质准确性。

Method: 提出两步算法，第一步优化能量，第二步加入惩罚项同时优化能量和1-RDM。

Result: k-UpCCGSD能量接近CISD，优化1-RDM显著提升电子性质；GateFabric优化后能量和1-RDM质量均改善。

Conclusion: 同时优化能量和1-RDM是提升变分量子算法精度的有效策略。

Abstract: The variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) is a promising method for
simulating molecular systems on near-term quantum computers. This approach
employs energy estimation; however, other relevant molecular properties can be
extracted from the one-particle reduced density matrix (1-RDM) generated by
VQE. The accuracy of these properties strongly depends on the reliability and
convergence of the 1-RDM, which is not guaranteed by energy-only optimization.
Thus, we investigate the effect of optimizing the 1-RDM within VQE to improve
the accuracy of both the energy and molecular properties. A two-step algorithm
was implemented that optimizes the energy and 1-RDM by incorporating a penalty
term in the cost function to enforce the convergence of the 1-RDM. The first
step focuses on energy minimization, while in the second step, a weighted
penalty is added to the cost function to promote simultaneous improvement of
the energy and 1-RDM. This approach was tested and validated for the k-UpCCGSD
and GateFabric ans\"atzes with active spaces (4,4) and (2,2), respectively.
k-UpCCGSD produces energies close to CISD, so optimizing 1-RDM has little
effect on the energy but significantly improves electronic properties such as
electron density, dipole moments, and atomic charges. GateFabric initially
shows higher energy deviations from CISD, but optimizing 1-RDM substantially
improves both the energy accuracy and the quality of 1-RDM. These results
demonstrate that simultaneous optimization of energy and 1-RDM is an effective
strategy to improve the accuracy of energies and molecular properties in
variational quantum algorithms.

Abstract: Quantum optical neural networks (QONNs) enable information processing beyond
classical limits by exploiting the advantages of classical and quantum optics.
However, simulation of large-scale bosonic lattices remains a significant
challenge due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space required to
describe a quantum network accurately. Consequently, previous theoretical
studies have been limited to small-scale systems, leaving the behaviour of
multimode QONNs largely unexplored. This work presents an efficient
computational framework based on the phase-space positive-P method for
simulating bosonic neuromorphic systems. This approach provides a view to
previously inaccessible regimes, allowing the validation of large-scale bosonic
networks in various quantum machine learning tasks such as quantum state
classification and quantum state feature prediction. Our results show that the
performance of a large quantum reservoir does not improve monotonously with the
number of bosonic modes, instead following a complex dependence driven by the
interplay of nonlinearity, reservoir size, and the average occupation of the
input mode. These findings are essential for designing and optimising optical
bosonic reservoirs for future quantum neuromorphic computing devices.

Abstract: We consider a three-mode electro-optomechanical system in which a mechanical
oscillator is coupled to an optical cavity and a LC circuit through radiation
pressure and capacitive coupling, respectively. By controlling the two-tone
driving of the optical cavity and the microwave driving of the LC circuit, the
strong squeezing of both the microwave field of the LC circuit and the
mechanical mode will be obtained. Moreover, by further altering the driving
power of the system, the perfect one-way Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering
between the optical cavity and the mechanical oscillator will be generated. The
degree of the one-way EPR steering can be controlled by the driving light of
the system. We also show the robustness of the squeezing and EPR steering
against environmental temperature. This scheme may provide a promising platform
for quantum information processing and microwave quantum communication.

Abstract: We present a detailed simulation and design framework for realizing traveling

disordered superconductors -- in our case niobium-titanium-nitride (NbTiN).
These kinetic inductance TWPAs (KITs) operate via three-wave mixing (3WM) to
achieve high broadband gain and near-quantum-limited (nQL) noise.
Representative fabricated devices -- realized using an inverted microstrip
(IMS), dispersion-engineered, artificial transmission line -- demonstrate power
gains above 25 dB, bandwidths beyond 3 GHz, and achieve ultimate system noise
levels of 1.1 quanta even when operated with no magnetic shielding. These
performance metrics are competitive with state-of-the-art
Josephson-junction-based TWPAs but involve simpler fabrication and able to
providing three orders of magnitude higher dynamic range ($IIP_1 = -68$ dBm,
$IIP_3 = -55$ dBm), and high magnetic field resilience -- making KITs an
attractive technology for highly multiplexed readout of quantum information and
superconducting detector systems.

Conclusion: 新方法有助于提升参数化量子电路在NISQ设备上的优化效率。

Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are pivotal components of variational
quantum algorithms (VQAs), which represent a promising pathway to quantum
advantage in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. PQCs enable
flexible encoding of quantum information through tunable quantum gates and have
been successfully applied across domains such as quantum chemistry,
combinatorial optimization, and quantum machine learning. Despite their
potential, PQC performance on NISQ hardware is hindered by noise, decoherence,
and the presence of barren plateaus, which can impede gradient-based
optimization. To address these limitations, we propose novel methods for
improving gradient-free optimizers Rotosolve, Fraxis, and FQS, incorporating
information from previous parameter iterations. Our approach conserves
computational resources by reallocating optimization efforts toward poorly
optimized gates, leading to improved convergence. The experimental results
demonstrate that our techniques consistently improve the performance of various
optimizers, contributing to more robust and efficient PQC optimization.

Abstract: Violation of local realism via Bell inequality - a profound and
counterintuitive manifestation of quantum theory that conflicts with the
prediction of local realism - is viewed to be intimately linked with quantum
entanglement. Experimental demonstrations of such a phenomenon using quantum
entangled states are among the landmark experiments of modern physics and paved
the way for quantum technology. Here we report the violation of the Bell
inequality that cannot be described by quantum entanglement in the system but
arises from quantum indistinguishability by path identity, shown by the
multi-photon frustrated interference. By analyzing the measurement of
four-photon frustrated interference within the standard Bell-test formalism, we
find a violation of Bell inequality by more than four standard deviations. Our
work establishes a connection between quantum correlation and quantum
indistinguishability, providing insights into the fundamental origin of the
counterintuitive characteristics observed in quantum physics.

Abstract: We present a quantum optimal control protocol to generate highly
spin-squeezed states in Rydberg atom arrays coupled via Ising-type Van der
Waals interactions. Using gradient-based optimization techniques we construct
time-dependent pulse sequences that steer an initial product state toward
highly entangled, spin-squeezed states with predefined magnetization and
squeezing axes. We focus on the Wineland parameter $\xi_W^2$ to measure spin
squeezing and our approach achieves near-optimal spin squeezing in
one-dimensional ring arrays of up to $N=8$ spins, generating states with
entanglement depths exceeding 6, and significantly outperforming conventional
quench dynamics for all system sizes studied. Remarkably, optimized pulse
sequences can be directly scaled to larger arrays without additional
optimization, achieving a squeezing parameter as low as $\xi_W^2 = 0.227$ in
systems containing $N=50$ spins. This work demonstrates the potential of
quantum optimal control methods for preparing highly spin-squeezed states,

Motivation: 块编码是量子算法中的基本原语，但其辅助量子位开销通常较大，因此需要减少这种开销。

Method: 第一部分证明了“时空权衡”的存在，提出了一种算法，可以近似地取消块编码中除一个辅助量子位外的所有量子位；第二部分评估了块编码相干乘法所需的最小辅助量子位数。

Result: 证明了精确乘法块编码时对数辅助量子位是最优的，但在某些块编码情况下，近似乘法可以仅用一个辅助量子位实现高精度。

Conclusion: 论文通过两种方法显著减少了块编码的辅助量子位开销，为量子算法设计提供了更高效的资源利用方案。

Abstract: Block encodings are a fundamental primitive in quantum algorithms, but can
often have large ancilla overhead. In this work, we introduce novel techniques
for reducing this overhead in two distinct ways. In Part I, we prove the
existence of a "space-time tradeoff" by deriving an algorithm that, for any
block encoding, approximately uncomputes all but one of its ancilla (freeing up
those ancillae for reuse in later parts of a quantum algorithm). In Part II, we
evaluate the minimum number of ancillae required to perform coherent
multiplication of block encodings. We prove that logarithmic ancillae is
optimal for exact multiplication of block encodings. However, in certain block
encoding regimes, we show that approximate multiplication of block encodings
can be achieved to high-precision with just one ancilla.

Method: 设计了两种协议，分别使用一个和两个双量子比特门，结合投影测量完成实验。实验在IBM Quantum和IonQ的多个设备上进行。

Result: 在几乎所有情况下，实验数据违反了Leggett-Garg不等式和时间顺序不变性，且违反程度超过5个标准差。非侵入性得到了定性和定量分析的支持。

Conclusion: 这些结果展示了量子测量的另一个特征，支持了弱扰动模型，并验证了量子系统的非经典行为。

Abstract: We present two protocols, with one and two two-qubit gates, to noninvasively
measure two incompatible observables on a qubit. Both protocols are completed
with a projective measurement. By gathering sufficiently large statistics, we
have been able to violate Leggett-Garg inequality and time-order invariance.
The detailed analysis of the data on 10 qubit sets from 5 devices available on
IBM Quantum and one on IonQ reveals violations beyond 5 standard deviations in
almost all cases. The noninvasiveness is supported by a qualitative and
quantitative agreement with the model of weak disturbance. These results show
another characteristic feature of quantum measurements.

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了Lindbladian模型拟合的效率和准确性，适用于实际量子计算应用。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of fitting Lindbladian models to the outputs of
quantum process tomography. A sequence of prior theoretical works approached
the problem by considering whether there exists a Lindbladian generator close
to a matrix logarithm of the tomographically estimated transfer matrix. This
technique must take into account the non-uniqueness of the matrix logarithm, so
that in general multiple branches of the logarithm must be checked. In
contrast, all practical demonstrations of Lindbladian fitting on real
experimental data have to our knowledge eschewed logarithm search, instead
adopting direct numerical optimisation or ad-hoc approaches tailored to a
particular experimental realisation. In our work, we introduce algorithmic
improvements to logarithm search, demonstrating that it can be applied in
practice to settings relevant for current quantum computing hardware. We
additionally augment the task of Lindbladian fitting with techniques from gate
set tomography to improve robustness against state preparation and measurement
(SPAM) errors, which can otherwise obfuscate estimates of the model underlying
the process of interest. We benchmark our techniques extensively using
simulated tomographic data employing a range of realistic error models, before
demonstrating their application to tomographic data collected from real
superconducting-qubit hardware.

Conclusion: 理论分析表明，当控制增益无限增长时，系统的纯度可以无限期保持，为量子信息保护提供了新思路。

Abstract: The present work analyzes state-stabilization techniques for decoupling a
subsystem from environmental interactions. The proposed framework uses
analytical and numerical tools to find an approximate decoherence-free subspace
(DFS) with enhanced passive noise isolation. Active state-stabilizing control
on a subsystem mediating dominant environmental interactions, which we call
wall subsystem, creates an effective quantum wall state. The proposed method
controls only the wall subsystem, leaving the logical subsystem untouched. This
simplifies logic operations in the protected subsystem, and makes it suitable
for integration with other quantum information protection techniques, such as
dynamical decoupling (DD). We demonstrated its effectiveness in enhancing the
performance of selective or complete DD. Under suitable conditions, our method
maintains system purity above a threshold for all times, achieving eternal
purity preservation. Theoretical analysis links this behavior to the asymptotic
spectrum of the Hamiltonian when the control gain grows unbounded.

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a novel trace inequality involving two operators. As
applications, we sharpen the one-shot achievability bound on the relative
entropy error in a wealth of quantum covering-type problems, such as soft
covering, privacy amplification, convex splitting, quantum information
decoupling, and quantum channel simulation by removing some dimension-dependent
factors. Moreover, the established one-shot bounds extend to
infinite-dimensional separable Hilbert spaces as well. The proof techniques are
based on the recently developed operator layer cake theorem and an operator
change-of-variable argument, which are of independent interest.

Abstract: We extend from the hyperfinite setting to general von Neumann algebras
Mosonyi and Ogawa's (2015) and Mosonyi and Hiai's (2023) results showing the
operational interpretation of sandwiched relative R\'enyi entropy in the strong
converse of hypothesis testing. The specific task is to distinguish between two
quantum states given many copies. We use a reduction method of Haagerup, Junge,
and Xu (2010) to approximate relative entropy inequalities in an arbitrary von
Neumann algebra by those in finite von Neumann algebras. Within these finite
von Neumann algebras, it is possible to approximate densities via finite
spectrum operators, after which the quantum method of types reduces them to
effectively commuting subalgebras. Generalizing beyond the hyperfinite setting
shows that the operational meaning of sandwiched R\'enyi entropy is not
restricted to the matrices but is a more fundamental property of quantum
information. Furthermore, applicability in general von Neumann algebras opens
potential new connections to random matrix theory and the quantum information
theory of fundamental physics.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动态因果顺序的新形式，特别是在多参与者情况下，因果顺序不受过去行为影响的可能性。

Method: 通过分析至少四个参与者的动态因果顺序，引入“不可影响的因果顺序”概念，并定义相关的量子过程类别。

Result: 发现了一种新的动态因果顺序，并明确了某些量子过程可以同时具有不确定和动态的因果顺序。

Conclusion: 论文扩展了对动态因果顺序的理解，为量子过程的研究提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: Requiring that the causal structure between different parties is well-defined
imposes constraints on the correlations they can establish, which define
so-called causal correlations. Some of these are known to have a "dynamical"
causal order in the sense that their causal structure is not fixed a priori but
is instead established on the fly, with for instance the causal order between
future parties depending on some choice of action of parties in the past. Here
we identify a new way that the causal order between the parties can be
dynamical: with at least four parties, there can be some dynamical order which
can nevertheless not be influenced by the actions of past parties. This leads
us to introduce an intermediate class of correlations with what we call
non-influenceable causal order, in between the set of correlations with static
(non-dynamical) causal order and the set of general causal correlations. We
then define analogous classes of quantum processes, considering recently
introduced classes of quantum circuits with classical or quantum control of
causal order - the latter being the largest class within the process matrix
formalism known to have a clear interpretation in terms of coherent
superpositions of causal orders. This allows us to formalise precisely in which
sense certain quantum processes can have both indefinite and dynamical causal
order.
