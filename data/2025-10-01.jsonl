Through empirical evaluation across multiple entanglement patterns,\ncircuit depths, and optimization strategies,quantum advantages in fraud\nclassification accuracy are demonstrated, achieving up to 94.3 % accuracy with\nZZ encoding schemes. The analysis reveals significant performance variations\nacross entanglement topologies, with circular entanglement consistently\noutperforming linear (90.7) %) and full connectivity (92.0 %) patterns,\nachieving optimal performance at 93.3 % accuracy. The study introduces novel\nvisualization methodologies for quantum circuit analysis and provides\nactionable deployment recommendations for practical quantum machine learning\nimplementations. Notably, systematic entanglement pattern analysis shows that\ncircular connectivity provides superior balance between expressivity and\ntrainability while maintaining computational efficiency.

In this work, we elucidate this phenomenon by introducing the related\nconcept of $\\textit{Krylov winding}$, whereby the operator wavefunction has a\nphase which winds linearly with the Krylov index. We argue that Krylov winding\nis a generic feature of quantum chaotic systems. It gives rise to size winding\nunder two additional conditions: (i) a low-rank mapping between the Krylov and\nsize bases, which ensures phase alignment among operators of the same size, and\n(ii) the saturation of the ``chaos-operator growth'' bound $\\lambda_L \\leq 2\n\\alpha$ (with $\\lambda_L$ the Lyapunov exponent and $\\alpha$ the growth rate),\nwhich ensures a linear phase dependence on size.

Yet, the extent of nonlocality in quantum theory is\nintrinsically bounded, falling short of the correlations permitted by the\nrelativistic causality (the no-signaling) principle. A paradigmatic example is\nthe Popescu-Rohrlich correlation: two distant parties sharing arbitrary\nentanglement cannot achieve this correlation, though it can be simulated with\nclassical communication between them. Here we show how such post-quantum\ncorrelations can instead be simulated using intrinsically non-signaling\nphysical resources, and implement the proposed scheme using a quantum circuit\non a four-qubit photonic platform. Unlike the conventional approaches, our\nmethod exploits dynamical correlations between distinct physical systems, with\nintrinsic randomness suppressing any signaling capacity. This enables the\nrealization of post-quantum correlations both with and without entanglement. We\nalso analyze how the simulation scheme extends to beyond quantum nonlocal\ncorrelations in multipartite systems.

Our constructions\nachieve the optimal circuit depth of $O(\\log n)$ for systems of $n$ qubits.

Herein, we\nuncover an intrinsic scaling law of the nonlocal magic resource and the bond\ndimension of matrix product states in Haar-random quantum circuits, that is,\nthe nonlocal magic resource is converged on a bond dimension in logarithmic\nscale with the system size. It means, in the practical simulations of quantum\ncircuits, merely small bond dimension suffices to bear with the dynamics of\nstabilizer R\\'{e}nyi entropy with rank $n=1,2$. On the other hand, the\nentanglement converges on a bond dimension exponentially scaled in the system\nsize. This remarkable difference reveals that, while the simulation of\nentanglement on a classical computer is limited, the utilization of nonlocal\nmagic resource as a characterization could make the simulation power much\nstronger.

To assess the fundamental scope of\nthis strategy in unitary dynamics, we ask whether two evolutions can be made\nuniformly opposite over a broad input ensemble, or whether quantum mechanics\nimposes a structural limit on such opposition. We address this by treating\nself-fidelity (survival probability) as a random variable on projective state\nspace and adopting the Pearson correlation coefficient as a device-agnostic\nmeasure of global opposition between two evolutions. Within this framework we\nestablish the following theorem: For any nontrivial pair of unitaries,\nself-fidelity maps cannot be point-wise complementary correlation on the entire\nstate space. Consequently, the mathematical lower edge of the correlation bound\nis not physically attainable, which we interpret as a unitary-geometric floor\non anti-contrast, independent of hardware specifics and noise models. We make\nthis floor explicit in realizable settings. In a single-qubit Bloch-sphere\nRamsey model, a closed-form relation shows that a residual common-mode\ncomponent persists even under nominally optimal tuning. In higher dimensions,\nHaar/design moment identities reduce ensemble means and covariances of\nself-fidelity to a small set of unitary invariants, yielding the same\nconclusion irrespective of implementation details. Taken together, these\nresults provide a model-independent criterion for what anti-contrast can and\ncannot achieve in unitary sensing protocols."}

We present a cavity design that delivers high\nefficiency, purity, and indistinguishability while also enabling easy\ntunability of the emission frequency across the THz range. A key challenge in\nthis new class of dressed-state sources is that, unlike standard solid-state\nsingle-photon sources, the dressed nature of the transitions can lead to\nundesired optical repumping during emission due to spontaneous photon emission\nin the visible range, which reduces the purity of the THz single-photon state.\nWe show that this issue can be mitigated through optimized pulse areas and a\nsufficiently high Purcell rate, criteria that are met by our proposed cavity\ndesign.
