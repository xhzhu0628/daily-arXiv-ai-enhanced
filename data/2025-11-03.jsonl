By extending the notion of efficiency proposed by Cabello [Phys. Rev.\nLett., vol. 85, no. 26, p. 5635, 2000] for quantum key distribution protocols\nto QSS, we define the efficiency of minimally authorized subsets. Furthermore,\nwe establish the relationship between the efficiency of minimally authorized\nsubsets and the idealized information rate of minimal access structures.\nFinally, we rigorously prove that the QSS schemes constructed in this work\nachieve the highest efficiency among existing solutions."}

This work characterizes phase synchronization\nof an effective spin-1 system, which is realized by coupling three quantum\nstates with infinite lifetime to auxiliary excited states that have a finite\nlifetime. Integrating out the excited states, the effective spin-1 model\nfeatures coherent and incoherent effective couplings. Our key findings are: (i)\nPhase synchronization can be controlled by adjusting the phases of the\ncouplings to the excited states. (ii) Unlike in the paradigmatic spin-1 system\nstudied in the literature, where the dissipative couplings describe decay into\nthe limit cycle state, the effective spin-1 model investigated in this work is\ngoverned by a competition between dissipative decay into and out of the limit\ncycle state, with the dissipative decay out of the limit cycle state playing a\ncritical role. (iii) We identify a parameter regime where phase synchronization\nof the effective spin-1 system is -- in the absence of coherent effective\ncouplings -- governed entirely by the effective dissipators. The effective\nspin-1 model is benchmarked through comparisons with master equation\ncalculations for the full Hilbert space. Physical insights are gained through\nanalytical perturbation theory calculations. Our findings, which are expected\nto hold for a broad class of energy level and coupling schemes, are\ndemonstrated using hyperfine states of $^{87}$Rb."}

The two ingoing photons with\narbitrary frequency-polarization spectrum impinge onto the sphere along two\ndifferent directions and, as consequence of matter losses, their scattering\ninvolves the three independent processes where two, one and zero outgoing\nphotons survive. Non-collinearity of ingoing photons causes the existence of\ntwo different quantum paths they can follow upon scattering, this producing\ninterference effects in the detection of the above three processes which is\ngoverned by the wavepacket spectral symmetry. By exploiting rotational\ninvariance, we show that different classes of scattering geometries exist such\nthat the coincidence detection of the scattered photons shows perfect\nconstructive or destructive (Hong-Ou-Mandel) interference, both for symmetric\nand antisymmetric wavepackets. To assess the impact of matter dispersion/losses\non quantum interference effects accompanying photons detection, we analyze the\nscattering of narrow band two-photon wavepackets by high-index dielectric lossy\nspheres. We show that classical Mie resonance peaks, due to their Fano-like\ntraits, yield very strong constructive and destructive interference effects,\noccurring when the wavepacket carrier frequency matches the resonance frequency\nand side Fano dip frequency, respectively. In addition we consider the overall\nscattering probabilities of two, one and zero photons and we prove that, at the\nMie resonance frequencies, they exhibit quantum interference effects which are\nextremely sensitive to the spectral symmetry of the input wavepacket, thus\nsuggesting an efficient spectral technique assisted by matter losses to\nidentify entanglement."}

In\nthe 4-wave-mixing scheme, two lasers drive the system, coherently trapping the\nsystem in a dark ground-state and coupling a signal transition, that may be in\nthe terahertz, to an idler transition that may be in the optical. The\nphoton-mediated dipole-dipole interactions between emitters generate collective\nsuper-/subradiant dipolar modes, both on the signal and the idler transition.\nAs the array is cooperative with respect to the signal transition, an incident\nsignal photon can efficiently couple into the array and is admixed into dipolar\nidler modes by the drive. Under specific criticality conditions, this admixture\nis into a superradiant idler mode which primarily decays into a specific,\nhighly directional optical photon that propagates within the array plane.\nOutside of the array, this photon may then be coupled into existing quantum\ndevices for further processing. Using a scattering-operator formalism we derive\nresonance and criticality conditions that govern this two-step process and\nobtain analytic transduction efficiencies. For infinite lattices, we predict\ntransduction efficiencies into specific spatial directions of up to 50%, while\nthe overall, undirected transduction efficiency can be higher. An analysis for\nfinite arrays of $N^2$ emitters, shows that the output is collimated into lobes\nthat narrow as $1/\\sqrt{N}$.
