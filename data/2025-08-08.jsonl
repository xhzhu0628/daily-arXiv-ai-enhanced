However, for most\nresearchers, access to compute time on quantum hardware is limited. This\nnecessitates the need to build simulators that mimic the execution of quantum\ncircuits on noisy quantum hardware accurately and scalably.\n  In this work, we propose TUSQ - Tracking, Uncomputation, and Sampling for\nNoisy Quantum Simulation. To represent the stochastic noisy channels\naccurately, we average the output of multiple quantum circuits with fixed noisy\ngates sampled from the channels. However, this leads to a substantial increase\nin circuit overhead, which slows down the simulation. To eliminate this\noverhead, TUSQ uses two modules: the Error Characterization Module (ECM), and\nthe Tree-based Execution Module (TEM).\n  The ECM tracks the number of unique circuit executions needed to accurately\nrepresent the noise. That is, if initially we needed $n_{1}$ circuit\nexecutions, ECM reduces that number to $n_{2}$ by eliminating redundancies so\nthat $n_{2} < n_{1}$. This is followed by the TEM, which reuses computation\nacross these $n_{2}$ circuits. This computational reuse is facilitated by\nrepresenting all $n_{2}$ circuits as a tree. We sample the significant leaf\nnodes of this tree and prune the remaining ones. We traverse this tree using\ndepth-first search.

In this paper, we propose Q-DPTS, a hybrid quantum-classical\nframework for Quantum Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting. Q-DPTS\ncombines Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) with per-sample gradient clipping\nand Gaussian noise injection, ensuring rigorous $(\\epsilon,\n\\delta)$-differential privacy. The expressiveness of quantum models enables\nimproved robustness against the utility loss induced by DP mechanisms. We\nevaluate Q-DPTS on the ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature) dataset, a\nstandard benchmark for long-term time series forecasting. Our approach is\ncompared against both classical and quantum baselines, including LSTM, QASA,\nQRWKV, and QLSTM. Results demonstrate that Q-DPTS consistently achieves lower\nprediction error under the same privacy budget, indicating a favorable\nprivacy-utility trade-off. This work presents one of the first explorations\ninto quantum-enhanced differentially private forecasting, offering promising\ndirections for secure and accurate time series modeling in privacy-critical\nscenarios."}

We show that a simple protocol based solely on random SWAP tests\nachieves the same fidelity as the Schur transform, which is optimal. This\nprotocol relies only on elementary two-qubit SWAP tests, which project a pair\nof qubits onto the singlet or triplet subspaces, to identify and isolate\nsinglet pairs, and then proceeds with the remaining qubits. For a system of $n$\nqubits, we show that after approximately $T \\approx n \\ln n$ random SWAP tests,\na sharp transition occurs: the probability of detecting any new singlet\ndecreases exponentially with $T$. Similarly, the fidelity of each remaining\nqubit approaches the optimal value given by the Schur transform, up to an error\nthat is exponentially small in $T$. More broadly, this protocol achieves what\nis known as weak Schur sampling and unitary Schur sampling with error\n$\\epsilon$, after only $2n \\ln(n \\epsilon^{-1})$ SWAP tests.

By employing a real-space scattering approach, we obtain analytical\nsolutions for the scattering amplitudes that remain valid in both Markovian and\nnon-Markovian regimes. We observe that an external driving field induces a\nsplitting of the transmission spectrum's dip into double dips, with the\ndistance between the two dips increasing as the strength of the driving field\nincreases. The chiral nature of the coupling allows for controlled switching\nbetween complete transmission and perfect reflection of incident photons. In\nthe Markovian limit, we predict robust perfect transmission at specific phase\nvalues, independent of the driving field parameters.Moreover, in the\nnon-Markovian regime, as the size of the giant atom increases, the oscillatory\nbehavior of the scattering spectrum becomes more pronounced. Adjusting the\ngiant atom size enables control over the number of decoupling points as well as\nthe number of complete reflection points."}

This creates a critical need for scalable, device-independent\ncertification methods. In this work, we introduce logical accreditation, a\nframework for efficiently certifying quantum computations performed on logical\nqubits. Our protocol is robust against general noise models, far beyond those\ntypically considered in performance analyses of quantum error-correcting codes.\nThrough numerical simulations, we demonstrate that logical accreditation can\nscalably certify quantum advantage experiments and indicate the crossover point\nwhere encoded computations begin to outperform physical computations. Logical\naccreditation can also find application in evaluating whether logical circuit\nerror rates are sufficiently low that error mitigation can be efficiently\nperformed, extending the entropy benchmarking method to the regime of\nfault-tolerant computation, and upper-bounding the infidelity of the logical\noutput state. Underpinning the framework is a novel randomised compiling scheme\nthat converts arbitrary logical circuit noise into stochastic Pauli noise. This\nscheme includes a method for twirling non-transversal logical gates beyond the\nstandard T-gate, resolving an open problem posed by Piveteau et al. [Piveteau\net al. PRL 127, 200505 (2001)].

In practice, various error sources degrade the quality of\nquantum states, and quantum state tomography (QST) is a standard diagnostic\ntool. However, in QST, multiple error sources gather in a single density\nmatrix, making it difficult to identify individual error sources. To address\nthis problem, we propose an automated method for quantifying error sources by\ncombining simulation and parameter optimization to reproduce the experimental\ndensity matrix. We focus on the experimental generation of time-bin entangled\nphoton pairs, for which we model the relevant error sources and simulate the\ndensity matrix with adjustable model parameters, thereby optimizing the\nparameters and minimizing the trace distance to the experimental data.\nOptimization of the parameters reduced the trace distance from 0.177 to 0.024,\nindicating that our modeled error sources explain 86% of the errors. Reducing\nthe predicted error sources improves the state quality, consistent with our\npredictions and thus validating the proposed method. In addition, the modular\nstructure of this framework makes it applicable to other quantum platforms,\nsuch as superconducting qubits, atoms, and solid-state spins."}

Moreover, the separation between the estimation and\nreconciliation phases can introduce error propagation. In this paper, we\npropose a novel joint message-passing scheme that unifies channel parameter\nestimation and information reconciliation within a Bayesian framework.

In this work, we introduce the partial projected ensemble (PPE) as a\nframework to study how the spatiotemporal structure of scrambling is imprinted\non projected ensembles. The PPE consists of an ensemble of mixed states induced\non a subsystem by measurements on a spatially separated part of its complement,\ntracing out the remainder, naturally capturing scenarios involving discarded\noutcomes or noise-induced losses. We show that statistical fluctuations of the\nPPE faithfully track the causal lightcone of information spreading, revealing\nhow scrambling dynamics are encoded in ensemble structure. In addition, we\ndemonstrate that the probabilities of bit-string probabilities (PoPs)\nassociated with the PPE exhibit distinct dynamical regimes and provide an\nexperimentally accessible probe of scrambling. Both PPE fluctuations and PoPs\ndisplay exponential sensitivity to the size of the discarded region, reflecting\nexponential degradation of quantum correlations under erasure. We substantiate\nthese findings using the non-integrable kicked Ising chain, combining numerics\nin the ergodic regime with exact results at its self-dual point.
