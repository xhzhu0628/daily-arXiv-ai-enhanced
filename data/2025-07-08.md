### [1] [Error correction, authentication, and false acceptance, probabilities for communication over noisy quantum channels: converse upper bounds on the bit transmission rate](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03035)
*Pete Rigas*

Main category: quant-ph

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Conclusion: 该上界方法为量子通信中的错误纠正协议提供了新的理论支持，尤其是在高噪声环境下。

Abstract: We obtain strict upper bounds on the bit transmission rate for communication
of Classical bit codewords over Quantum channels. Albeit previous arguments in
arXiv: 1804.01797 which have demonstrated that lower bounds can be shown to
hold for the bit transmission rate without the presence of significant noise
over the channel shared by Alice and Bob for the purposes of encoding,
decoding, transmission and authentication, the author suggests that upper
bounding the bit transmission rate could be of use towards classifying
paradoxical aspects of communication protocols, as well as constructing error
correcting codes which are resilient to noise. The upper bound that is obtained
in this work for the bit transmission rate, as a converse result, is dependent
upon the natural logarithm of the size of each player's alphabet, as well as
smaller alphabets, which can be leveraged for simultaneously realizing Quantum
advantage for maximizing error correction and minimizing false acceptance.
Crucially, the upper bound to the bit transmission rate is dependent upon a
pruning procedure, which seeks to determine whether letters from player's
alphabets can be removed so that prospective Quantum advantage, in order for
Alice and Bob to implement error correction protocols with high probability,
despite the fact that there is more noise over the channel between Alice and
Bob in comparison to that between Bob and Eve.

Abstract: Among the fundamental quantum effects, quantum reflection (QR) is one of the
most notable phenomena. Approximating arbitrary potentials in the Schr\"odinger
equation as multistep potentials allows us to determine the reflection
coefficient by means of a Riccati equation. We introduce a measure for the
wavefunction's characteristic reflection distance and derive an analytical
expression for this reflection point in an arbitrary power-law potential. We
study the associated QR rate in the context of Casimir--Polder atom surface
interactions, revealing its strong dependence on critical parameters such as
velocity and interaction duration. As an application, we demonstrate how the
matter-wave diffraction of a low-velocity metastable Argon beam impinging on a
rotated grating facilitates high-precision potential analysis.

Conclusion: 该模拟器显著提升了量子计算的模拟效率和实际运行成本。

Abstract: Efficient stabilizer-based computation is a key task in quantum computing as
it provides a classically tractable insight into quantum algorithms, which
otherwise quickly become impossible at scale on a classical device.
Formulations in quantum error correction, hardware verification, hybrid
computing, and more, all benefit from the ability of Clifford gates to be
accurately evaluated by classical computers. However, current stabilizer
simulators have significant limitations in scaling and use-case beyond direct
simulation. To address this, we present a GPU-accelerated tableau stabilizer
simulator that scales efficiently in direct circuit simulation, and supports a
range of stabilizer-based tasks. We show how the simulator is used to quickly
calculate Pauli commutation groupings between Pauli strings to reduce the
number of circuit runs in quantum chemistry problems. We also present a
Clifford+T circuit transpiler based on STABSim, which uses the simulator
framework to track relations in non-Clifford rotations as Clifford gates are
absorbed into the measurement step of the circuit. The T rotation layers left
behind are then further optimized in the simulator structure to create a
reduced circuit containing only the minimum non-Clifford rotations, improving
the time to simulate and reducing the cost to run on real quantum devices.

### [4] [Estimating Quantum Execution Requirements for Feature Selection in Recommender Systems Using Extreme Value Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03229)

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效估计在多个量子平台上获得满意解所需的运行次数。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为量子解决方案的可靠性提供了定量评估工具，有助于在实际应用中更高效地使用量子硬件。

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing have significantly accelerated research
into quantum-assisted information retrieval and recommender systems,
particularly in solving feature selection problems by formulating them as
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems executable on
quantum hardware. However, while existing work primarily focuses on
effectiveness and efficiency, it often overlooks the probabilistic and noisy
nature of real-world quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a solution
based on Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to quantitatively assess the usability of
quantum solutions. Specifically, given a fixed problem size, the proposed
method estimates the number of executions (shots) required on a quantum
computer to reliably obtain a high-quality solution, which is comparable to or
better than that of classical baselines on conventional computers. Experiments
conducted across multiple quantum platforms (including two simulators and two
physical quantum processors) demonstrate that our method effectively estimates
the number of required runs to obtain satisfactory solutions on two widely used
benchmark datasets.

### [5] [Qumode-Based Quantum Image Storage with Entropy-Guided Frame Indexing and Fidelity-Preserved Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03290)
*Sanjit Krishna*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于连续变量光子系统的量子图像存储框架，通过相干态位移算子将灰度图像编码为量子模式，并利用熵索引实现高效存储与检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于量子比特的方法在图像存储中存在局限性，需要一种更高效且与光子兼容的量子存储模型。

Method: 使用相干态位移算子编码图像，通过delta演化机制记录帧间强度变化，并引入基于冯·诺依曼熵的索引方法。

Result: 模拟实验展示了部分保真度和相干相空间行为，验证了框架的可行性。

Conclusion: 该框架为量子视觉和成像应用提供了一种可扩展的光子兼容量子存储方案。

Abstract: I propose a novel framework for quantum image storage using
continuous-variable (CV) photonic systems. Unlike traditional qubit-based
approaches, this model encodes grayscale image intensities into qumodes via
coherent-state displacement operators. A delta evolution mechanism enables
memory efficient storage by recording only intensity shifts between frames. To
support scalable retrieval, I introduce entropy based frame indexing using von
Neumann entropy. The proposed system is simulated using Strawberry Fields,
demonstrating partial fidelity preservation and coherent phase-space behavior
via Wigner function visualization. This approach offers a promising pathway
toward scalable, photonic-compatible quantum memory models for quantum vision
and imaging applications.

### [6] [Optimal quantum measurements for additive information and disturbance measures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03346)
*Hiroaki Terashima*

Main category: quant-ph

TL;DR: 论文定义了基于对数变换的加性信息与扰动度量，用于量子测量，展示了其与乘性度量的差异及最优测量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息与扰动在独立测量中自然具有加性，而传统乘性度量（如保真度）不直接体现这一点。

Method: 通过对数将乘性度量（如估计和操作保真度）转换为加性度量。

Result: 加性度量在最小扰动与信息权衡下，改变了最优测量的选择。

Conclusion: 加性度量更适用于独立测量场景，揭示了与传统度量不同的最优测量关系。

Abstract: Additive measures for information and disturbance in quantum measurements of
a system are defined from well-known multiplicative measures such as estimation
and operation fidelities using a logarithm. This is motivated by the fact that
information and disturbance are naturally assumed to be additive while
performing independent measurements on separable systems. Although the
additivity makes no remarkable difference when information and disturbance are
separately considered, it can change measurements that only introduce minimal
disturbance relative to the amount of information. Such optimal measurements
are shown for additive information and disturbance measures with a tradeoff
relationship.

### [7] [Optimising germanium hole spin qubits with a room-temperature magnet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03390)
*Cecile X. Yu,Barnaby van Straaten,Alexander S. Ivlev,Valentin John,Stefan D. Oosterhout,Lucas E. A. Stehouwer,Francesco Borsoi,Giordano Scappucci,Menno Veldhorst*

Result: 获得了较长的退相干时间和高保真度单量子比特门操作。

Conclusion: 室温磁体可实现高性能量子比特，有助于大规模量子处理器的扩展。

Abstract: Germanium spin qubits exhibit strong spin-orbit interaction, which allow for
high-fidelity qubit control, but also provide a strong dependence on the
magnetic field. Superconducting vector magnets are often used to minimize
dephasing due to hyperfine interactions and to maximize spin control, but these
compromise the sample space and thus challenge scalability. Here, we explore
whether a permanent magnet outside the cryostat can be used as an alternative.
Operating in a hybrid mode with an internal and external magnet, we find that
we can fine-tune the magnetic field to an in-plane orientation. We obtain a
qubit dephasing time T2*=13 microseconds, Hahn-echo times T2H=88 microseconds,
and an average single-qubit Clifford gate fidelity above 99.9%, from which we
conclude that room temperature magnets allow for high qubit performance.
Furthermore, we probe the qubit resonance frequency using only the external
magnet, with the internal superconducting magnet switched off. Our approach may
be used to scale semiconductor qubits and use the increased sample space for
the integration of cryogenic control circuitry and wiring to advance to
large-scale quantum processors.

### [8] [Theory of Three-Photon Transport Through a Weakly Coupled Atomic Ensemble](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03428)

Conclusion: 该研究为非平衡量子光学和非高斯光子传输提供了新的理论工具。

Abstract: Understanding multi-photon interactions in non-equilibrium quantum systems is
an outstanding challenge in quantum optics. In this work, we develop an
analytical and diagrammatic framework to explore three-photon interactions in
atomic ensembles weakly coupled to a one-dimensional waveguide. Taking
advantage of the weak coupling, we use our diagrammatic framework to perform
perturbation theory and calculate the leading-order contributions to the
three-photon wavefunction, which would otherwise be intractable. We then
compute the outgoing photon wavefunction of a resonantly driven atomic
ensemble, with photon-photon interactions truncated up to three photons. Our
formulation not only captures the individual transmission of photons but also
isolates the connected S-matrix elements that embody genuine photon-photon
correlations. Through detailed analysis, we obtain the analytic expressions of
the connected third-order correlation function and the third-order
electric-field-quadrature cumulant, which reveal non-Gaussian signatures
emerging from the interplay of two- and three-photon processes. We also
calculate the optical depth where non-Gaussian photon states can be observed.
Numerical simulations based on a cascaded master equation validate our
analytical predictions on a small-scale system. These results provide a
formalism to further explore non-equilibrium quantum optics in atomic ensembles
and extend this to the regime of non-Gaussian photon transport.

### [9] [Spatial Leggett-Garg Inequalities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03440)

Main category: quant-ph

Motivation: 研究多体系统中量子扰动的传播特性，验证Leggett-Garg不等式在空间扩展下的适用性。

Method: 通过三个观测者在不同时间和位置测量多体系统，构建空间Leggett-Garg不等式，并以海森堡链为例进行验证。

Result: 实验显示不等式首次被违反的时间与测量点距离成正比，且增加相互作用范围会提前违反时间。

Conclusion: 空间Leggett-Garg不等式为分析多体量子系统的非相对论动力学提供了新工具。

Abstract: We formulate a spatial extension of the Leggett-Garg inequality by
considering three distant observers locally measuring a many-body system at
three subsequent times. The spatial form, in particular, is specially suited to
analyze propagation of quantum perturbations through spin chains, by capturing
how a measurement at one site can later affect distant sites due to the
interactions. We illustrate our proposal for a Heisenberg chain in a magnetic
field, showing indeed that the first inequality-violation time scales
proportionally to the distance between measuring parties. We attribute this
phenomenon to Lieb-Robinson physics and, confirming this connection, we find
that violations are anticipated when increasing the interaction range. The
inequality violation, readily observable in current experiments, demonstrates
the incompatibility between two-point correlation functions and the
macrorealistic hypothesis. In outlook, spatial Leggett-Garg inequalities
constitute a new tool for analyzing the non-relativistic dynamics of many-body
quantum systems.

Conclusion: 该算法在避免缓存缺失的同时，对读出误差具有鲁棒性，并提出无需纠错的准确性验证策略。

Abstract: The neighbor search is a computationally demanding problem, usually both
time- and memory-consuming. The main problem of this kind of algorithms is the
long execution time due to cache misses. In this work, we propose a quantum
algorithm for the Fixed RAdius Neighbor Search problem (FRANS) based on the
fixed-point version of Grover's algorithm. We derive an efficient circuit for
solving the FRANS with linear query complexity with the number of particles
$N$. The quantum circuit returns the list of all the neighbors' pairs within
the fixed radius, together with their distance, avoiding the slow down given by
cache miss. We explicitly write the Grover's operator and analyze its gate
complexity. The whole algorithm has complexity of
$\mathcal{O}(M^{\frac{1}{2}}N^{2})$ in the worst-case scenario, where $M$ is
the number of neighboring pairs, and uses $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ number of
qubits. By employing extra ancilla qubits the depth of the circuit can be
brought down to $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ at the cost of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ qubits
for unstructured dataset, or $\mathcal{O}(\text{poly}(\log N))$ qubits for
structured datasets. Finally we assess the resilience of the model to the
readout error, suggesting an error correction-free strategy to check the
accuracy of the results.

Result: 发现QFI峰值在早期动态中增强，且高温度和初始基态布居数会放大这一效应；量子相干性和初始关联进一步提高了QFI峰值。

Conclusion: 量子关联是提高温度估计精度的关键因素，研究为设计高精度量子传感器提供了有效初始状态和实验指导。

Abstract: We investigate an nonequilibrium quantum thermometry protocol in which an
ensemble of qubits, acting as temperature probes, is weakly coupled to a
macroscopic thermal bath. The temperature of the bath, the parameter of
interest, is encoded in the dissipator of a Markovian thermalization process.
For some relevant initial states, we observe a peak in the Quantum Fisher
Information (QFI) during the transient of the thermalization, indicating
enhanced sensitivity in early-time dynamics. This effect becomes more
pronounced at higher bath temperatures and is further enhanced when the qubits'
initial state has a larger ground-state population. Our analysis shows that
both local coherence in the probes' initial state and initial correlations
among the probes contribute to the amplification of the peak in the QFI, thus
improving the precision of the temperature estimation. The influence of quantum
correlations emerges as a central feature of this work. Although the dynamics
does not permit superlinear scaling of the QFI with the number of probes, we
identify the most effective initial states for designing high-precision quantum
sensors within this setting. We also provide concrete guidelines for
experimental implementations.

Conclusion: 量子Fisher信息与纠缠的关系具有普适性，为实验设计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: It is a specific type of quantum correlated state that achieves optimal
precision in parameterestimation under unitary encoding. We consider the
potential experimental limitation on probe entanglement, and find a relation
between achievable precision and initial probe entanglement, in both bipartite
and multipartite scenarios. For two-qubit probes, we analytically derive an
exact relationship between the entanglement-constrained optimal quantum Fisher
information and the limited initial entanglement, measured via both generalized
geometric measure and entanglement entropy. We demonstrate that this
fundamental relationship persists across the same range of the entanglement
measures even when higher-dimensional bipartite probes are considered.
Furthermore, we identify the specific states that realize maximum precision in
these scenarios. Additionally, by considering the geometric measure of
entanglement, we extend our approach to multiqubit probes. We find that in
every case, the optimal quantum Fisher information exhibits a universal
behavior:a steep increase in the low-entanglement regime, followed by a gradual
and nearly-saturated improvement as the probe entanglement approaches values
close to those required for achieving the Heisenberg limit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际QKD系统同时存在源和探测器的不完美性，现有方法仅单独解决其中一种，无法满足现实需求。

Method: 结合BB84类协议的现有技术，构建统一的安全证明框架。

Result: 成功设计出能同时处理源和探测器不完美性的安全证明方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著缩小了理论安全证明与实际QKD实现之间的差距。

Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) promises information-theoretic security based
on quantum mechanics, but practical implementations face security
vulnerabilities due to device imperfections. Recent advances have separately
addressed source and detector imperfections in phase-error-estimation based
security proof frameworks, but this is not enough to protect real-world QKD
systems suffering from both types of imperfections simultaneously. In this
work, we show that existing techniques for BB84-type protocols can be combined
to construct a unified security proof that simultaneously accounts for both
source and detector imperfections. Our approach thus represents a significant
step towards closing the gap between theoretical security proofs and practical
QKD implementations.

Abstract: Quantum reservoir computing is a machine learning scheme in which a quantum
system is used to perform information processing. A prospective approach to its
physical realization is a photonic platform in which continuous variable (CV)
quantum information methods are applied. The simplest CV quantum states are
Gaussian states, which can be efficiently simulated classically. As such, they
provide a benchmark for the level of performance that non-Gaussian states
should surpass in order to give a quantum advantage. In this article we propose
two methods to extract more performance from Gaussian states compared to
previous protocols. We consider better utilization of the measurement
distribution by sampling its cumulative distribution function. We show it
provides memory in areas that conventional approaches are lacking, as well as
improving the overall processing capacity of the reservoir. We also consider
storing past measurement results in classical memory, and show that it improves
the memory capacity and can be used to mitigate the effects of statistical
noise due to finite measurement ensemble.

Conclusion: 该方法为量子自旋动力学研究提供了一种可扩展且实验可行的途径。

Abstract: We demonstrate an experimentally feasible circuit-QED Bose-Hubbard simulator
that reproduces the complex spin dynamics of Heisenberg models. Our method
relies on mapping spin-1/2 systems onto bosonic states via the polynomially
expanded Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. The HP transformation
translates the intricate behavior of spins into a representation that is
compatible with bosonic devices like those in a circuit QED setup. For
comparison, we also implement the Dyson-Maleev (DM) encoding for spin-1/2 and
show that, in this limit, DM and HP are equivalent. We show the equivalence of
the DM and the HP transformations for spin-1/2 systems. Rigorous numerical
analyses confirm the effectiveness of our HP-based protocol. Specifically, we
obtain the concurrence between the spin dynamics and the behavior of microwave
photons within our circuit QED-based analog simulator that is designed for the
Bose-Hubbard model. By utilizing the microwave photons inherent to circuit QED
devices, our framework presents an accessible, scalable avenue for probing
quantum spin dynamics in an experimentally viable setting.

measurements was primarily determined by the initial Bohmian positions within
the measurement apparatus. This is nevertheless not always the case. Part II is
a short addendum with a more general discussion: cases where the measurement
results reveal the values of the positions attached to the measured system, the
measurement apparatus, or both, are considered.

Abstract: We introduce a method for shaping a cold atom cloud using a vortex laser beam
with a polarisation singularity at its center, which creates a point of
vanishing intensity. Exploiting this feature we experimentally demonstrate two
different schemes to create micron-scaled line- and sheet-like atomic density
distributions. In the dynamic scheme, atoms in the bright beam regions are
accelerated and therefore effectively removed from the cloud. In the dark-state
scheme, these atoms are pumped into a state that does not interact with the
shaping light. In both cases, an atomic distribution remains, either as a thin
line or as a sheet when an additional polarizer is used. We find good agreement
between the experimental results and our theoretical model, which predicts the
method to be in principle not diffraction-limited.

Abstract: We present a compact, ionization-based detector for the state-selective and
spatially resolved measurement of individual Rydberg atoms trapped in the
vicinity of an atom chip. The system combines an electrostatic lens system for
guiding charged particles with an array of channel electron multipliers (CEMs)
capable of detecting both ions and electrons produced by ionization. Designed
for quantum information applications, this device enables the detection of
correlations between spatially separated Rydberg qubits. Additionally, the
electrodes provide compensation for stray electric fields and control over
particle trajectories. The imaging system achieves a total magnification of
more than 12, with a single-axis magnification up to 200, while maintaining low
aberrations. We characterize the performance of the system using a charged
particle trajectory simulation software and discuss how a coincidence
measurement of ions and electrons can be used to calibrate the detection
efficiency. This detector enables high-fidelity measurement of multiple Rydberg
atoms and is well-suited for applications in cavity-mediated quantum gates.

Motivation: 传统线性耦合读取方案存在Purcell效应和光子数限制，影响信噪比和QND特性。

Method: 采用非线性耦合（基于transmon分子）和高功率读取模式，结合参量放大器。

Result: 在89光子下读取保真度达99.21%，QND特性为96.7%；理论临界光子数为377。

Conclusion: 非线性耦合在高功率读取中表现优异，为高保真量子比特读取提供了新途径。

Abstract: The field of superconducting qubits is constantly evolving with new circuit
designs. However, when it comes to qubit readout, the use of simple transverse
linear coupling remains overwhelmingly prevalent. This standard readout scheme
has significant drawbacks: in addition to the Purcell effect, it suffers from a
limitation on the maximal number of photons in the readout mode, which
restricts the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the Quantum Non-Demolition (QND)
nature of the readout. Here, we explore the high-power regime by engineering a
nonlinear coupling between a transmon qubit and its readout mode. Our approach
builds upon previous work by Dassonneville et al. [Physical Review X 10, 011045
(2020)], on qubit readout with a non-perturbative cross-Kerr coupling in a
transmon molecule. We demonstrate a readout fidelity of 99.21% with 89 photons
utilizing a parametric amplifier. At this elevated photon number, the QND
nature remains high at 96.7%. Even with up to 300 photons, the QNDness is only
reduced by a few percent. This is qualitatively explained by deriving a
critical number of photons associated to the nonlinear coupling, yielding a
theoretical value of $\bar{n}_r^\text{crit} = 377$ photons for our sample's
parameters. These results highlight the promising performance of the transmon
molecule in the high-power regime for high-fidelity qubit readout.

Conclusion: 为近未来量子机器学习算法的实用化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Quantum processors may enhance machine learning by mapping high-dimensional
data onto quantum systems for processing. Conventional quantum kernels, or
feature maps, for encoding data features onto a quantum circuit are currently
impractical, as the number of entangling gates scales quadratically with the
dimension of the dataset and the number of qubits. In this work, we introduce a
quantum kernel designed to handle high-dimensional data with a significantly
reduced number of qubits and entangling operations. Our approach preserves
essential data characteristics while promoting computational efficiency, as
evidenced by extensive experiments on benchmark datasets that demonstrate a
marked improvement in both accuracy and resource utilization, as compared to
state-of-the-art quantum feature maps. Our noisy simulations results combined
with lower resource requirements highlight our kernel's ability to function
within the constraints of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. Through
numerical simulations and small-scale implementation on a superconducting
circuit quantum computing platform, we demonstrate that our scheme performs on
par or better than a set of classical algorithms for classification. Our
findings herald a promising avenue for the practical implementation of quantum
machine learning algorithms on near future quantum computing platforms.

Abstract: We develop a novel approach for Linear combination of unitaries (LCU) type
decomposition for structured sparse matrices. Such matrices frequently arise
during numerical solution of partial differential equations which are
ubiquitous in science and engineering. LCU is a versatile quantum algorithmic
primitive that plays an important role in context of both variational quantum
algorithms (VQA) and fully fault-tolerant ones, and has been applied to a
diverse range of problems. Conventionally, Pauli basis is used for LCU
decomposition, which however in worst case can result in number of LCU terms
that scale quadratically with respect to the matrix size. We show that by using
an alternate basis one can better exploit the sparsity and underlying structure
of matrix leading to number of tensor product terms which scale only
logarithmically with respect to the matrix size. We develop numerical and
semi-analytical approaches for computing sigma basis decomposition for an
arbitrary matrix. Given this new basis is comprised of non-unitary operators,
we employ the concept of unitary completion to design efficient quantum
circuits for evaluation of the expectation values of operators composed of
tensor product of elements from sigma basis which can be used for cost function
evaluation in VQAs. We also develop an approach for block encoding of arbitrary
operator given its decomposition in sigma basis which could be used in variety
of fully fault-tolerant algorithms. We compare our approach with other related
concepts in the literature including unitary dilation and provide numerical
illustrations on several PDE examples.

Abstract: Quantum correlated states of light, such as squeezed states, are a
fundamental resource for the development of quantum technologies, as they are
needed for applications in quantum metrology, quantum computation, and quantum
communications. It is thus critical to develop compact, efficient, and robust
sources to generate such states. Here we report on a compact, narrowband,
fiber-coupled source of two-mode squeezed states of light at 795 nm based on
four wave mixing (FWM) in a $^{85}$Rb atomic vapor. The source is designed in a
small modular form factor, with two input fiber-coupled beams, the seed and
pump beams required for the FWM, and two output fibers, one for each of the
modes of the squeezed state. The system is optimized for low pump power (135
mW) to achieve a maximum intensity-difference squeezing of 4.4 dB after the
output fibers at an analysis frequency of 1 MHz. The narrowband nature of the
source makes it ideal for atomic-based quantum sensing and quantum networking
configurations that rely on atomic quantum memories. Such a source paves the
way for a versatile and portable platform for applications in quantum
information science.

Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and
profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors
that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies.
Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open
quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the
Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled
driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian
and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the
quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs
of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent
quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small
negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of
these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the
classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase
transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry.
Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced
dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus.
We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter,
revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws
are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the
quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon
and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions
and superconducting circuits.

Abstract: We study measurement-induced phase transitions in quantum circuits consisting
of kicked Ising models with postselected weak measurements, whose dynamics can
be mapped onto a classical dynamical system. For a periodic (Floquet)
non-unitary evolution, such circuits are exactly tractable and admit
volume-to-area law transitions. We show that breaking time-translation symmetry
down to a quasiperiodic (Fibonacci) time evolution leads to the emergence of a
critical phase with tunable effective central charge and with a fractal origin.
Furthermore, for some classes of random non-unitary circuits, we demonstrate
the robustness of the volume-to-area law phase transition for arbitrary random
realizations, thanks to the emergent compactness of the classical map encoding
the circuit's dynamics.

Abstract: Strong laser light drives complex quantum electron dynamics in solids, which
is captured by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process. Here we report the
observation of laser-dressed Floquet-Bloch states (FBSs) at the edge of the
Brillouin zone (BZ) in HHG, by driving a large-bandgap MgO crystal in the
strong-field regime where the laser pulse is intense enough both to accelerate
electrons to the BZ edge as well as to dress the bands. We experimentally show
and numerically confirm that the HHG spectrum encodes the nonadiabatic coupling
between the conduction bands and FBSs, induced by the high-intensity driver,
when some high harmonics are resonant with the dressed band structure. This
enables us to trace the bandgap morphology - expanding HHG-spectroscopy
techniques to cover the HHG tomography of the BZ edge.

Abstract: We present a quantum jump/trajectory analysis of the two-photon interference
phenomenon in the context of the Hong-Ou-Mandel effect (HOME). In particular,
we consider the standard setup of HOME, which consists of two-photon sources
firing single photons from the opposite sides of a 50/50 beam splitter and two
perfect detectors placed at the output ports to record photodetection events.
For single-photon sources, we consider two special cases: (1) two excited
two-level atoms and (2) two atom-cavity setups with initially present single
photons in both cavities. For both cases, we report analytic results as well as
quantum jump-based Monte Carlo simulations to demonstrate the signatures of
these single-photon sources on the HOME under different working conditions (for
example, strong- and weak-coupling regimes of cavity quantum electrodynamics).
Our results may have interesting applications in linear optics quantum

single-photon sources.

practicality of generating random numbers from two quantum platforms:
gate-based circuits on IBM Quantum and (Gaussian) boson sampling with Xanadu

from real quantum hardware using the NIST SP800-22r1a test suite and measure
the extraction efficiency of each debiasing method. Results show that, while
unbiased bitstreams can be achieved on both platforms, throughput remains low
and cost per random bit is high compared to specialized QRNG devices.

Abstract: C-band photons are recognized for having the lowest loss coefficient in
optical fibers, making them highly favorable for optical fiber-based
communication. In this study, we systematically investigated the temporal width
of C-band heralded single photons and developed a theoretical model for
biphoton generation via the spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) process using a
diamond-type transition scheme, which has not been previously reported. Our
experimental data on temporal width closely aligns with the predictions of this
model. Additionally, we introduced a new concept: the atomic velocity group
relating to the two-photon resonance condition and the one-photon detuning in
this atomic frame. These two parameters are crucial for understanding the
behavior of the biphoton source. The concept indicates that the hot-atom source
behaves similarly to the cold-atom source. Guided by our theoretical model, we
observed 1529-nm (C-band) heralded single photons with a temporal width of
28.3$\pm$0.6 ns, corresponding to a linewidth of 11.0$\pm$0.2 MHz. For
comparison, the ultimate linewidth limit is 6.1 MHz, determined by the natural
linewidth of the atoms. Among all atom-based sources of 1300 to 1550 nm
heralded single photons utilizing either cold or hot atoms, the temporal width
achieved in this work represents the first instance of a width exceeding 10 ns,
making it (or its linewidth) the longest (or narrowest) record to date. This
work significantly enhances our understanding of diamond-type or cascade-type
SFWM biphoton generation and marks an important milestone in achieving greater
temporal width in atom-based sources of C-band heralded single photons.

Abstract: Quantum entanglement constitutes a pivotal resource, serving as a fundamental
cornerstone within the field of quantum information science. In recent years,
the study of vortex light entanglement has garnered widespread attention due to
its unique structure and inherent advantages; however, the majority of these
investigations are primarily focused on discrete variable (DV) systems. In this
paper, we present a theoretical framework for generating vortex optical
entanglement in coherently prepared media, employing continuous variable (CV)
analysis and leveraging Raman scattering as an alternative to the conventional
spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) method. The entanglement arises
from the quantum correlation between the two light fields, induced by atomic
coherence. Using numerical simulations, we thoroughly explore the impact of
various tunable system parameters on the degree of entanglement, ultimately
identifying the optimal conditions for maximal entanglement. Our findings offer
a reference framework for vortex light entanglement, with potential
implications across quantum teleportation, quantum key distribution, quantum
computing, high-dimensional quantum information, and other related fields.

Abstract: We present a general approach to error detection of bosonic quantum
error-correction codes via an adaptive quantum phase estimation algorithm
assisted by a single ancilla qubit. The approach is applicable to a broad class
of bosonic codes whose error syndromes are described by symmetry or stabilizer
operators, including the rotation-symmetric codes and Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill
(GKP) codes. The detection precision scales inversely with the total evolution
time and thus reaches the Heisenberg limit. We numerically demonstrate the
approach for several examples, such as detecting bosonic excitation loss errors
in high-order cat or binomial codes and displacement errors in finite-energy
GKP codes. We also extend the approach to efficiently generate arbitrary Fock
states. Our schemes are feasible in present-day experiments.

Abstract: Rabin oblivious transfer is the cryptographic task where Alice wishes to
receive a bit from Bob but it may get lost with probability 1/2. In this work,
we provide protocol designs which yield quantum protocols with improved
security. Moreover, we provide a constant lower bound on any quantum protocol
for Rabin oblivious transfer. To quantify the security of this task with
asymmetric cheating definitions, we introduce the notion of cheating advantage
which may be of independent interest in the study of other asymmetric
cryptographic primitives.

Abstract: We assess the potential of quantum computing to accelerate computation of
central tasks in genomics, focusing on often-neglected theoretical limitations.
We discuss state-of-the-art challenges of quantum search, optimization, and
machine learning algorithms. Examining database search with Grover's algorithm,
we show that the expected speedup vanishes under realistic assumptions. For
combinatorial optimization prevalent in genomics, we discuss the limitations of
theoretical complexity in practice and suggest carefully identifying problems
genuinely suited for quantum acceleration. Given the competition from excellent
classical approximate solvers, quantum computing could offer a speedup in the
near future only for a specific subset of hard enough tasks in assembly, gene
selection, and inference. These tasks need to be characterized by core
optimization problems that are particularly challenging for classical methods
while requiring relatively limited variables. We emphasize rigorous empirical
validation through runtime scaling analysis to avoid misleading claims of
quantum advantage. Finally, we discuss the problem of trainability and
data-loading in quantum machine learning. This work advocates for a balanced
perspective on quantum computing in genomics, guiding future research toward
targeted applications and robust validation.

Abstract: The wavefunction of two identical bosons remains invariant under particle
exchange - a fundamental quantum symmetry that underlies Bose-Einstein
statistics. We report the direct experimental observation of bosonic exchange
symmetry in the temporal wavefunction of photon pairs generated via spontaneous
four-wave mixing in a three-level cold atomic ensemble. The measured two-photon
temporal correlations show excellent agreement with theoretical predictions
based on symmetrized bosonic wavefunctions. In addition, we perform
time-resolved two-photon interference to reconstruct the complex temporal
wavefunction. Both the amplitude and phase profiles exhibit clear symmetry
under photon exchange, providing a direct confirmation of bosonic exchange
symmetry in the time domain.

Abstract: Temperature estimation, known as thermometry, is a critical sensing task for
physical systems operating in the quantum regime. Indeed, thermal fluctuations
can significantly degrade quantum coherence. Therefore, accurately determining
the system's operating temperature is a crucial first step toward
distinguishing thermal noise from other sources of decoherence. In this work,
we estimate the unknown temperature of a collection of identical and
independent two-level atoms dispersively probed by a single-mode quantized
electromagnetic field. In contrast to previous works, we present an analytical
sensing analysis demonstrating that the joint atom-field evolution -- without
any assumptions or approximations -- can achieve, at best, the standard quantum
limit of precision concerning the number of field excitations. To investigate
our analysis further, we propose and implement a quantum thermometer based on a
nonlinear Mach-Zehnder interferometer, which we realize through quantum digital
simulation. Our simulation is highly flexible regarding atomic state
preparation, allowing the initialization of atomic ensembles with positive and
effective negative temperatures. This makes our platform a promising and
versatile testbed for benchmarking thermometric capabilities in current quantum
simulators.

Conclusion: 解析安全性证明可直接推广到相干攻击场景，被动实现与主动实现性能相近。

Abstract: The Bennett-Brassard 1984 protocol (BB84 protocol) is one of the simplest
protocols for implementing quantum key distribution (QKD). In the protocol, the
sender and the receiver iteratively choose one of two complementary measurement
bases. Regarding the basis choice by the receiver, a passive setup has been
adopted in a number of its implementations including satellite QKD and time-bin
encoding one. However, conventional theoretical techniques to prove the
security of BB84 protocol are not applicable if the receiver chooses his
measurement basis passively, rather than actively, with a biased probability,
followed by the measurement with threshold detectors. Here we present a fully
analytical security proof for such a decoy-state BB84 protocol with receiver's
passive basis choice and measurement with threshold detectors. Thanks to the
analytic nature, our security proof can straightforwardly be lifted up to the
one over coherent attacks. The numerical simulations under practical situations
show that the difference in secure key rate between the active and the passive
implementations of the protocol is negligible except for long communication
distances.

Abstract: Unlike classical algorithms, where second quantization is ubiquitous, the
nature of quantum computers enables both the first- and second-quantized
representations to be on somewhat equal footing. While quantum algorithms of
both quantizations provide advantages over classical algorithms for ground
state calculation and time-evolution, they face distinct limitations and
inefficiencies in addressing real-world molecular and material simulation
problems. As an example, the first-quantized representation is unsuitable for
calculating electron non-conserving properties, such as dynamic correlations.
Conversely, the ground-state molecular orbital wavefunction efficiently
prepared in the second quantization may benefit from efficient first-quantized
measurement circuits. In light of this, we propose a hybrid quantization scheme
for electronic simulations that employs a conversion circuit to switch
efficiently between the two quantizations, achieving a gate cost of
$\mathcal{O}(N\log N \log M)$ and requiring $\mathcal{O}(N \log M)$ qubits for
a system of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals. This way, plane-wave Hamiltonian
simulations can be done efficiently in the first-quantization before converting
to the second quantization to apply electron non-conserving operations.
Similarly, second-quantized Hamiltonian simulation algorithms can take
advantage of efficient measurement circuits originally designed for the
first-quantized representation. We discuss applications of this hybrid
quantization scheme to bring polynomial circuit improvements in the
characterization of ground-state and excited-state properties, and in
performing ab-initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations of highly featured problems represents
a formidable challenge, where reaching high precision across multiple length
scales can require a prohibitive amount of computer memory or computing time.
However, the solutions to physics problems typically have structures operating
on different length scales, and as a result exhibit a high degree of
compressibility. Here, we use the quantics tensor train representation to build
a solver for the time-dependent Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We demonstrate that
the quantics approach generalizes well to the presence of the non-linear term
in the equation. We show that we can resolve phenomena across length scales
separated by seven orders of magnitude in one dimension within one hour on a
single core in a laptop, greatly surpassing the capabilities of more naive
methods. We illustrate our methodology with various modulated optical trap
potentials presenting features at vastly different length scales, including
solutions to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on two-dimensional grids above a
trillion points ($2^{20} \times 2^{20}$). This quantum-inspired methodology can
be readily extended to other partial differential equations combining spatial
and temporal evolutions, providing a powerful method to solve highly featured
differential equations at unprecedented length scales.

Conclusion: 分数主量子数的轨道缺乏物理意义，且线性独立性无法保证，参数α不适合作为变分参数。

Abstract: Complete orthonormal sets of exponential-type orbitals with non-integer
principal quantum numbers are discussed as basis functions in non-relativistic
Hartree-Fock-Roothaan electronic structure calculations of atoms. A method is
proposed to construct accurate and computationally efficient basis sets using
these orbitals. It is demonstrated that principal quantum numbers of fractional
order cannot be treated solely as variational parameters, since such a
procedure may lead to unphysical basis sets (in particular, linearly dependent
Slater-type functions). Ground-state total energies for the Be- and Ne-
isoelectronic series are calculated. The results obtained are lower than those
reported using other published basis sets. However, the energies obtained using
Slater-type functions with non-integer principal quantum numbers are omitted
from the comparison. These "orbitals" have no physical interpretation (except
the "1s", which coincides with a hydrogenlike eigenfunction). In general linear
independence of such Slater-type orbitals is not guaranteed. The results
confirm that the parameter alpha, used to represent the complete orthonormal
exponential-type orbitals in the weighted Hilbert space, is neither observable
nor suitable to be considered as a variational parameter, despite its treatment
as such in some prior work.

Abstract: Entanglement generation between distant nodes is a fundamental process in
distributed quantum information processing. Qudits, high-dimensional quantum
states, are promising candidates for enhancing entanglement distribution
capabilities. However, the success probability of qudit entanglement
distribution using Bell measurements is typically lower than that of
conventional qubit-based protocols. In this paper, we propose a novel
entanglement swapping protocol specifically designed for qutrits
(three-dimensional quantum states). Our protocol employs photon-number encoding
combined with an additional mode basis, such as polarization, effectively
increasing the success probability. We show that the proposed qutrit protocol
can achieve higher entanglement generation rates compared to conventional
two-photon detection-based qubit protocols, especially under conditions of
limited photon generation probability. Furthermore, we evaluate our protocol
under realistic experimental imperfections, including photon loss and threshold
detection, and show that it achieves high fidelity with probabilistic photon
sources.

Abstract: Measurement is a fundamental operation in quantum computing and has many
important use cases in quantum algorithms. This article provides a
comprehensive overview of the basic measurement operations in quantum computing
and represents a selected set of their applications in quantum algorithms. Our
goal is to provide one of the first algorithmic overviews of measurement
processes in quantum computing. From the quantum information-theoretical
perspective, measurements are either a method to access the result of a quantum
computation or a technique to modify a quantum state. We also identify
measurement-based methods to solve quantum computational challenges, such as
error mitigation and circuit cutting. We discuss three main categories of
measurements: performing measurements in static quantum circuits, modifying the
quantum state in dynamic quantum circuits via measurements, and addressing
challenges in quantum computing with measurements. Based on the reviewed
topics, the measurement operations are frequently not at the center of the
quantum algorithm design. However, the most novel and error-prone quantum
algorithms will likely require sophisticated measurement schemes. Thus, the
central message of this article is to broaden the view of measurement
operations and highlight their importance at every level of quantum algorithm
design.

Abstract: Energy-efficient healthcare systems are becoming increasingly critical for
Industry 5.0 as the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) expands, particularly
with the integration of 5G technology. 5G-enabled IoMT systems allow real-time
data collection, high-speed communication, and enhanced connectivity between
medical devices and healthcare providers. However, these systems face energy
consumption and data security challenges, especially with the growing number of
connected devices operating in Industry 5.0 environments with limited power
resources. Quantum computing integrated with machine learning (ML) algorithms,
forming quantum machine learning (QML), offers exponential improvements in
computational speed and efficiency through principles such as superposition and
entanglement. In this paper, we propose and evaluate three QML algorithms,
which are UU{\dag}, variational UU{\dag}, and UU{\dag}-quantum neural networks
(QNN) for classifying data from four different datasets: 5G-South Asia, Lumos5G
1.0, WUSTL EHMS 2020, and PS-IoT. Our comparative analysis, using various
evaluation metrics, reveals that the UU{\dag}-QNN method not only outperforms
the other algorithms in the 5G-South Asia and WUSTL EHMS 2020 datasets,
achieving 100% accuracy, but also aligns with the human-centric goals of
Industry 5.0 by allowing more efficient and secure healthcare data processing.
Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed quantum algorithms is verified
against several noisy channels by analyzing accuracy variations in response to
each noise model parameter, which contributes to the resilience aspect of
Industry 5.0. These results offer promising quantum solutions for 5G-enabled
IoMT healthcare systems by optimizing data classification and reducing power
consumption while maintaining high levels of security even in noisy
environments.

Abstract: Simulating a quantum circuit with a classical computer requires exponentially
growing resources. Decision diagrams exploit the redundancies in quantum
circuit representation to efficiently represent and simulate quantum circuits.
But for complicated quantum circuits like the quantum supremacy benchmark,
there is almost no redundancy to exploit. Therefore, it often makes sense to do
a trade-off between simulation accuracy and memory requirement. Previous work
on approximate simulation with decision diagrams exploits this trade-off by
removing less important nodes. In this work, instead of removing these nodes,
we try to find similar nodes to replace them, effectively slowing down the
fidelity loss when reducing the memory. In addition, we adopt Locality
Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to drastically reduce the computational complexity for
searching for replacement nodes. Our new approach achieves a better
memory-accuracy trade-off for representing a quantum circuit with decision
diagrams with minimal run time overhead. Notably, our approach shows good
scaling properties when increasing the circuit size and depth. For the first
time, a strong better-than-linear trade-off between memory and fidelity is
demonstrated for a decision diagram based quantum simulation when representing
the quantum supremacy benchmark circuits at high circuit depths, showing the
potential of drastically reducing the resource requirement for approximate
simulation of the quantum supremacy benchmarks on a classical computer.

Abstract: Quantum circuit simulation is paramount to the verification and optimization
of quantum algorithms, and considerable research efforts have been made towards
efficient simulators. While circuits often contain high-level gates such as
oracles and multi-controlled X (CkX) gates, existing simulation methods require
compilation to a low-level gate-set before simulation. This, however, increases
circuit size and incurs a considerable (typically exponential) overhead, even
when the number of high-level gates is small. Here we present a gadget-based
simulator which simulates high-level gates directly, thereby allowing to avoid
or reduce the blowup of compilation. Our simulator uses a stabilizer
decomposition of the magic state of non-stabilizer gates, with improvements in
the rank of the magic state directly improving performance. We then proceed to
establish a small stabilizer rank for a range of high-level gates that are
common in various quantum algorithms. Using these bounds in our simulator, we
improve both the theoretical complexity of simulating circuits containing such
gates, and the practical running time compared to standard simulators found in
IBM's Qiskit Aer library. We also derive exponential lower-bounds for the
stabilizer rank of some gates under common complexity-theoretic hypotheses. In
certain cases, our lower-bounds are asymptotically tight on the exponent.

Abstract: Bandits with knapsacks (BwK) constitute a fundamental model that combines
aspects of stochastic integer programming with online learning. Classical
algorithms for BwK with a time horizon $T$ achieve a problem-independent regret
bound of ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ and a problem-dependent bound of ${O}(\log T)$. In
this paper, we initiate the study of the BwK model in the setting of quantum
computing, where both reward and resource consumption can be accessed via
quantum oracles. We establish both problem-independent and problem-dependent
regret bounds for quantum BwK algorithms. For the problem-independent case, we
demonstrate that a quantum approach can improve the classical regret bound by a
factor of $(1+\sqrt{B/\mathrm{OPT}_\mathrm{LP}})$, where $B$ is budget
constraint in BwK and $\mathrm{OPT}_{\mathrm{LP}}$ denotes the optimal value of
a linear programming relaxation of the BwK problem. For the problem-dependent
setting, we develop a quantum algorithm using an inexact quantum linear
programming solver. This algorithm achieves a quadratic improvement in terms of
the problem-dependent parameters, as well as a polynomial speedup of time
complexity on problem's dimensions compared to classical counterparts. Compared
to previous works on quantum algorithms for multi-armed bandits, our study is
the first to consider bandit models with resource constraints and hence shed
light on operations research.

Abstract: A quantum key distribution network enables pairs of users to generate
independent secret keys by leveraging the principles of quantum physics. For
end-to-end secure communication, a user pair's secret key must remain secure
against any third parties, including both external eavesdroppers and other
network users. However, isolating a given user pair from the remaining users
while maintaining a high key rate is challenging when all users are
intrinsically coupled and correlated, particularly in continuous-variable
networks. This results in either a low key rate, or incomplete end-to-end
security. Here, we introduce a multi-user security framework, offering a
general and comprehensive end-to-end key rate formula, against the
collaboration of the other network users and eavesdropper. Building on this
framework, we propose a multi-user protocol that achieves the theoretical upper
limit in all practical deployments within a 100 km range. Applied to a
three-node network, it achieves an Mbps-level per-user key rate and an overall
network key rate reaching 90\% of the upper limit. The proposed solution
supports scalable implementations using telecom-compatible components, while
the method for obtaining the accessible information in the network is broadly
applicable and can be extended to various multipartite quantum information

Abstract: Scalable quantum networks require quantum repeaters to overcome major
challenges such as photon loss and decoherence in long-distance quantum
communication. In this paper, we present a cavity-magnon quantum repeater
architecture that exploits the frequency tunability and coherence
characteristics of magnonic platforms to enable efficient entanglement swapping
across multi-hop networks. Through comprehensive numerical simulations with
realistic experimental parameters, we analyze system performance across diverse
deployment scenarios and network scales, examining both short-range and
long-distance implementations. We identify critical factors influencing
performance and scalability, demonstrating that cavity-magnon systems represent
a viable and promising quantum repeater platform with significant integration
advantages over existing quantum memory technologies.

Abstract: We present a two-step protocol for quantum measurement tomography that is
light on classical co-processing cost and still achieves optimal sample
complexity in the system dimension. Given measurement data from a known probe
state ensemble, we first apply least-squares estimation to produce an
unconstrained approximation of the POVM, and then project this estimate onto
the set of valid quantum measurements. For a POVM with $L$ outcomes acting on a
$d$-dimensional system, we show that the protocol requires $\mathcal{O}(d^3 L
\ln(d)/\epsilon^2)$ samples to achieve error $\epsilon$ in worst-case distance,
and $\mathcal{O}(d^2 L^2 \ln(dL)/\epsilon^2)$ samples in average-case distance.
We further establish two almost matching sample complexity lower bounds of
$\Omega(d^3/\epsilon^2)$ and $\Omega(d^2 L/\epsilon^2)$ for any non-adaptive,
single-copy POVM tomography protocol. Hence, our projected least squares POVM
tomography is sample-optimal in dimension $d$ up to logarithmic factors. Our
method admits an analytic form when using global or local 2-designs as probe
ensembles and enables rigorous non-asymptotic error guarantees. Finally, we
also complement our findings with empirical performance studies carried out on
a noisy superconducting quantum computer with flux-tunable transmon qubits.

Conclusion: 非厄米XY模型展示了准能量简并点与拓扑相变的联系，为理解非厄米系统的拓扑性质提供了新视角。

Abstract: The XY spin chain is a paradigmatic example of a model solved by free
fermions, in which the energy eigenspectrum is built from combinations of
quasi-energies. In this article we show that by extending the XY model's
anisotropy parameter $\lambda$ to complex values, it is possible for two of the
quasi-energies to become degenerate. In the non-Hermitian XY model these
quasi-energy degeneracies give rise to exceptional points (EPs) where two of
the eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. The distinct
$\lambda$ values at which EPs appear form concentric rings in the complex plane
which are shown in the infinite system size limit to converge to the unit
circle coinciding with the boundary between distinct topological phases. The
non-Hermitian model is also seen to possess a line of broken $PT$ symmetry
along the pure imaginary $\lambda$-axis. For finite systems, there are four EP
values on this broken $PT$-symmetric line if the system size is a multiple of
4.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the Schr\"odinger equation in a
three-dimensional helically twisted space characterized by a non-trivial
torsion parameter. By applying exact separation of variables, we derive the
radial equation governing the dynamics of quantum particles in this geometric
background. Remarkably, the intrinsic coupling between angular and longitudinal
momenta induced by the torsion gives rise to an attractive Coulomb-like
potential term that emerges purely from the underlying geometry, without
introducing any external fields or interactions. We obtain exact analytical
solutions for the bound states, including both the energy spectrum and the
normalized wave functions. Numerical calculations are also performed, and
excellent agreement with the exact results is found. The interplay between the
torsion parameter and the effective Coulomb-like interaction is analyzed in
detail, showing how geometric deformation generates novel quantum confinement
mechanisms in twisted spaces.

Abstract: The question of whether entanglement between photons is equivalent to
entanglement between their characteristic field modes, specifically, the
single-particle wavefunctions that are composed and superposed to describe
identical particles, is a key, open problem concerning multi-partite optical
degrees of freedom, and has profound implications for topics ranging from
quantum foundations to quantum computation. In this Letter, I offer a fresh,
deeper, physical insight into this subtle, albeit enduring, issue by describing
a situation in which entangling interactions between optical modes, namely, the
wavefunctions can be distilled into genuine entanglement between the physical
properties of the photons, which are the wavefunctional degrees of freedom.
This theoretical observation also highlights the salience of the measurement
context, especially, of clearly disambiguating between the choice of the
quantum subsystem and the decision to measure an observable along a particular
axis of measurement, while quantifying and transforming quantum optical
entanglement. This understanding might be applied to formulate a new class of
protocols for distilling quantum magic from contextually and nonlocally
entangled photons within inseparable field modes.

Abstract: This paper presents the exact ground state solution for a diatomic particle
system with position-dependent complex mass under action of a complex Morse
potential in the quantum domain. By solving the position-dependent
Schr\"odinger equation in extended complex phase space without assuming a
specific mass profile, we derive both the eigenfunctions and corresponding
eigenenergies using the analyticity conditions of the eigenfunctions. A key
focus is placed on addressing the challenge of normalization inherent in
non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. To overcome the limitations of conventional
normalization methods in systems with complex potentials and spatially varying
mass, we propose a modified normalization approach based on a two-dimensional
integral over phase space. The results reveal that, under certain parameter
constraints, real energy spectra can arise in non Hermitian settings, supported
by normalized and physically meaningful eigenfunctions. Probability density
plots validate the existence of stable, localized bound states, maintaining
essential characteristics of the traditional Morse potential. Moreover, the
model offers potential applications in high-energy and cosmological physics,
particularly in the quantum description of exotic systems like dark matter.

Abstract: Efficient qubit reset and leakage reduction are essential for scalable
superconducting quantum computing, particularly in the context of quantum error
correction. However, such operations often require additional on-chip
components. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a mode-efficient
approach to qubit reset and readout using a multi-mode Purcell filter in a
superconducting quantum circuit. We exploit the inherent multi-mode structure
of a coplanar waveguide resonator, using its fundamental and second-order modes
for qubit reset and readout, respectively, thereby avoiding additional circuit
elements. Implemented in a flip-chip architecture, our device achieves
unconditional reset with residual excitation below 1% in 220 ns, and a leakage
reduction unit that selectively resets the second excited state within 62 ns.
Simulations predict Purcell-limited relaxation times exceeding 1 ms over an 800
MHz bandwidth. To our knowledge, this is the first experimental trial that
exploits different-order modes of a microwave resonator for distinct qubit
operations, representing a new direction toward scalable, mode-efficient
quantum processor design.

Abstract: We experimentally investigated a single-qubit quantum classifier implemented
on a silicon photonic integrated circuit, focusing on its performance under
photon-limited conditions. Using the Data Reuploading method with layer-wise
optimization via Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO), input data were encoded
into the photonic circuit, and classification was performed based on output
detection probabilities. Heralded single photons, generated via spontaneous
four-wave mixing in a silicon waveguide, served as the input states. Even when
the average number of photon samples per input was reduced to approximately
two, the classifier achieved nearly 90\% accuracy, provided that the training
dataset was sufficiently large. The experimental results were consistent with
numerical simulations, which also indicated that performance at low sample
sizes can be improved by increasing the size of the training dataset. These
findings demonstrate that photonic quantum classifiers can operate effectively
with very few photons, supporting their practical feasibility for
resource-efficient quantum machine learning on integrated photonic platforms.

Abstract: Most quantum algorithms for generalized eigenvalue problems focus on
Hermitian systems, and few are applicable to non-Hermitian systems. Based on
the generalized Schur decomposition, we propose a variational quantum algorithm
for solving generalized eigenvalue problems in non-Hermitian systems. The

searching for unitary transformation matrices. Moreover, we develop a method

devices. Finally, we numerically validate the algorithm's performance through
simulations and demonstrate its application to generalized eigenvalue problems
in ocean acoustics. The algorithm's robustness is further confirmed through
noise simulations.

Abstract: Multiport interferometers can be constructed out of two-port components in
various ways. We study how this choice affects the quality of the operations
performed by the interferometer, through the asymmetry of optical losses in the
multiport. We find that some operations benefit from asymmetrically designed
interferometers. Our results point to a fundamental tradeoff between lowering
infidelity and achieving high success rates, which are key considerations in
quantum information processing applications. Our results challenge the common
understanding that balanced losses are always optimal for quantum information
processing tasks.

Abstract: We propose an exercise in which one attempts to deduce the formalism of
quantum mechanics solely from phenomenological observations. The only assumed
inputs are the multi-time probability distributions estimated from the results
of sequential measurements of quantum observables; no presuppositions about the
underlying mathematical structures are permitted. In the concluding Part II of
the paper, we carry out the deduction of the formalism from the
phenomenological inputs described in Part I. We show that the resulting
formalism exhibits an affinity with Hilbert spaces, and we derive an explicit
representation in terms of those mathematical structures. Analogues of the
obtained elementary building blocks -- such as projection operators -- are
readily identifiable within the standard formalism. However, once these
building blocks are assembled according to the blueprint of the deduced
bi-trajectory formalism, it becomes evident that the new and the standard
formalisms differ substantially at the conceptual level. These differences do
not negate the fact that both formalisms are in perfect agreement with respect
to empirically testable predictions. Rather, the emergence of a novel,
non-standard formulation should be seen as a relatively rare opportunity to
reassess, from a fresh perspective, some of the long-standing foundational
issues in the theory. The hope is that the new approach may prove more
successful in addressing problems that have resisted resolution within the
established theoretical framework.

Abstract: Quantum multiparameter estimation offers a framework for the simultaneous
estimation of multiple parameters, pertaining to possibly noncommutating
observables. While the optimal probe for estimating a single unitary phase is
well understood - being a pure state that is an equal superposition of the
eigenvectors of the encoding Hamiltonian corresponding to its maximum and
minimum eigenvalues - the structure of optimal probes in the multiparameter
setting remains more intricate. We investigate the simultaneous estimation of
two phases, each encoded through arbitrary qubit Hamiltonians, using arbitrary
weight matrices, and considering single-qubit probes. We also consider
single-qutrit probes, for which the encoding Hamiltonians are chosen as SU(2)
generators. We find that in both the qubit and qutrit scenarios, the optimal
probe is a coherent superposition of the eigenstates corresponding to the
largest and smallest eigenvalues of the total encoding Hamiltonian, with a
fixed - and not arbitrary - relative phase. Remarkably, this optimal probe is
independent of the specific choice of weight matrix, making it a universally
optimal input state for the estimation of any pair of SU(2) parameters, which
can be reparameterized to the phase estimation problem. Furthermore, we show
that this probe also maximizes the determinant of the quantum Fisher
information matrix, providing a handy tool for identifying the optimal probe
state. We also examine the role of commutativity between the generators of the
unitary encodings. Our results demonstrate that a high degree of commutativity
degrades the achievable precision, rendering estimation infeasible in the
extreme case. However, maximal noncommutativity does not necessarily yield
optimal precision.

Abstract: The precise control of light-matter interaction serves as a cornerstone for
diverse quantum technologies, spanning from quantum computing to advanced atom
optics. Typical experiments often feature multi-mode fields and require atoms
with intricate internal structures to facilitate e.g., multi-photon
interactions or cooling. Moreover, the development of high-precision cold-atom
sensors necessitates the use of entangled atoms. We introduce a rigorous,
second-quantized framework for describing multi-$\Lambda$-atoms in a cavity,
encompassing their center-of-mass motion and interaction with a two-mode
electromagnetic field. A key feature of our approach is the systematic
application of a Hamiltonian averaging theory to the atomic field operators,
enabling the derivation of a compact and physically insightful effective
Hamiltonian governing the system's time evolution. This effective Hamiltonian
not only incorporates the AC-Stark and Bloch-Siegert shifts, augmented by
contributions from all involved ancillary states, but also includes effects
from counter-rotating terms, offering a more complete description than
conventional RWA-based models. A significant finding is the emergence of a
particle-particle interaction mediated by ancillary states, stemming directly
from the combined quantum nature of the coupled electromagnetic field and
atomic system. We illustrate the practical implications of our model through an
analysis of atomic Raman diffraction, determining the time evolution for a
typical initial state and demonstrating the resulting Rabi oscillations.
Furthermore, our results confirm that both the atomic and optical
Hong-Ou-Mandel effect can be observed within this Raman configuration,
utilizing a specific two-particle input state, thereby extending the utility of
Raman diffraction for quantum interference phenomena and providing a
microscopic model of the effect.

Abstract: Resonance fluorescence of natural or artificial atoms constitutes a prime
method for generating non-classical light. While most efforts have focused on
producing single-photons, multi-photon emission is unavoidably present in the
resonant driving of an atom. Here, we study the extent to which these processes
occur: we quantify the multi-photon emission statistics in a resonantly-driven
two-level artificial atom -- a semiconductor quantum dot in a micropillar
cavity -- when pumped by short optical pulses. By measuring auto-correlation
functions up to the fourth order, we observe up to four photons emitted after a
single pumping pulse, and investigate the emission dynamics with finely
resolved temporal measurements. Furthermore, we propose a method based on
acquisition time gating to enhance the purity of a single-photon source while
maintaining high efficiencies. Our results deepen the understanding of the
photon emission processes in coherently driven atomic systems, and suggest a
simple but effective technique to reduce the multi-photon components of a
single-photon source.

Abstract: As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, quantum
operating systems become inevitable, where multi-programming -- the core
functionality of operating systems -- enables concurrent execution of multiple
quantum programs to enhance hardware utilization. However, most quantum
compilation work focuses solely on single-circuit execution, severely limiting
resource efficiency and hindering quantum operating system development. We
propose Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer (DYNAMO), a method
that realizes multi-programming on neutral atom quantum architectures through
parallel compilation and intelligent resource allocation across multiple
quantum processing units (QPUs). DYNAMO addresses two critical challenges:
inefficient and difficult resource partitioning, and complex scheduling
conflicts from concurrent program. Our method enables efficient spatial and
temporal resource sharing while maintaining circuit correctness and hardware
constraints. Experimental evaluation across circuits ranging from 12 to over
1200 gates demonstrates that DYNAMO achieves up to 14.39x compilation speedup
while reducing execution stages by an average of 50.47%. Furthermore, DYNAMO
successfully distributes workloads across multiple QPUs with balanced resource
utilization. By enabling efficient multi-programming capabilities, DYNAMO
establishes a critical foundation towards realizing practical quantum operating
systems.

Abstract: Understanding the Lie algebraic structure of a physical problem often makes
it easier to find its solution. In this paper, we focus on the Lie algebra of
Gaussian-conserving superoperators. We construct a Lie algebra of $n$-mode
states, $\mathfrak{go}(n)$, composed of all superoperators conserving
Gaussianity, and we find it isomorphic to
$\mathbb{R}^{2n^2+3n}\oplus_{\mathrm{S}}\mathfrak{gl}(2n,\mathbb{R})$. This
allows us to solve the quadratic-order Redfield equation for any, even
non-Gaussian, state. We find that the algebraic structure of Gaussian
operations is the same as that of super-Poincar\'e algebra in three-dimensional
spacetime, where the CPTP condition corresponds to the combination of causality
and directionality of time flow. Additionally, we find that a bosonic density
matrix satisfies both the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations. Finally, we
expand the algebra of Gaussian superoperators even further by relaxing the CPTP
condition. We find that it is isomorphic to a superconformal algebra, which
represents the maximal symmetry of the field theory. This suggests a deeper
connection between two seemingly unrelated fields, with the potential to
transform problems from one domain into another where they may be more easily
solved.

Abstract: We propose and analyze a generalized model of photodetection in which the
detector couples simultaneously to both electric and magnetic components of the
electromagnetic field. Extending Glauber's seminal theory, we show that such
detectors, now experimentally feasible via meta-materials, can yield
interference patterns that depend strongly on the internal response of the
detector. In particular, we show that for a two-source interference setup,
coherent electric-magnetic dipole coupling can suppress or enhance interference
visibility, revealing a clear instance of measurement contextuality in quantum
optics, where the outcome depends on how the system is probed.

Result: 发现衰减指数α在(2,2.89)时出现Efimov效应，α=2时出现半超Efimov效应。

Conclusion: 理论预测为未来量子模拟平台的实验提供了可能验证的方向。

Abstract: Understanding how quasi-particles interact with impurities is crucial for
unveiling novel properties of quantum many-body systems. A prominent example is
the enhanced scattering between electrons and magnetic impurities in the
low-energy limit, which gives rise to the Kondo effect. In this letter,
motivated by recent developments in quantum simulation platforms, we
investigate the universal behavior of long-range quantum spin chains with a
single local impurity, focusing on systems that conserve the magnon number.
Using effective field theory, we show that distinct classes of universal
three-magnon states can emerge when the impurity-mediated two-magnon
interaction is on resonance. When the long-range coupling decays as
$1/r^\alpha$, we find that (i) for $\alpha\in (2,2.89)$, the system exhibits
Efimov effects, with the three-body binding energy forming a geometric series
$\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-n (\alpha-1) \pi/s_0(\alpha)$, (ii) for
$\alpha=2$, the system shows semi-super Efimov effects with
$\ln|E^{(n)}_{\text{3-body}}|\sim-(n\pi-\theta)^2/8$. Our theoretical
prediction is validated by the numerical solution of the
Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation. Our results could be tested experimentally
in the future on quantum simulation platforms.

Conclusion: 实验成功验证了高维中熵不确定性关系的紧致性。

Abstract: We provide experimental validation of tight entropic uncertainty relations
for the Shannon entropies of observables with mutually unbiased eigenstates in
high dimensions. In particular, we address the cases of dimensions $d = 3$, $4$
and $5$ and consider from $2$ to $d+1$ mutually unbiased bases. The experiment
is based on pulsed frequency bins measured with a multi-output quantum pulse
gate, which can perform projective measurements on a complete high-dimensional
basis in the time-frequency domain. Our results fit the theoretical
predictions: the bound on the sum of the entropies is never violated and is
saturated by the states that minimize the uncertainty relations.

Abstract: The mixing of two different gases is one of the most common natural
phenomena, with applications ranging from CO$_2$ capture to water purification.
Traditionally, mixing is analyzed in the context of local thermal equilibrium,
where systems exchange energy with a heat bath. Here, we study mixing in an
isolated system with potentially non-equilibrium initial states, characterized
solely by macroscopic observables. We identify the entropy of mixing as a
special case of observational entropy within an observer-dependent framework,
where both entropy and extractable work depend on the resolution of
measurement. This approach naturally resolves the Gibbs mixing paradox in
quantum systems: while an observer experiences a discontinuous increase in
entropy upon learning of the existence of two particle types, this knowledge
does not provide an advantage in work extraction if the types of particles
remain operationally indistinguishable in their measurements. Finally, we
derive a Landauer-like bound on the difference in energy extracted by two
observers, where an "observational temperature" emerges, determined by the
accessible information. These results provide a foundation for rigorously
determining the energy required to unmix in non-equilibrium settings and extend
beyond quantum systems, offering insights into the thermodynamics of isolated
classical gases.

Conclusion: 论文揭示了纠缠相变的多样性，为量子多体系统的纠缠控制提供了新的理论工具和算法支持。

Abstract: In unitary circuit games, two competing parties, an "entangler" and a
"disentangler", can induce an entanglement phase transition in a quantum
many-body system. The transition occurs at a certain rate at which the
disentangler acts. We analyze such games within the context of matchgate
dynamics, which equivalently corresponds to evolutions of non-interacting
fermions. We first investigate general entanglement properties of fermionic
Gaussian states (FGS). We introduce a representation of FGS using a minimal
matchgate circuit capable of preparing the state and derive an algorithm based
on a generalized Yang-Baxter relation for updating this representation as
unitary operations are applied. This representation enables us to define a
natural disentangling procedure that reduces the number of gates in the
circuit, thereby decreasing the entanglement contained in the system. We then
explore different strategies to disentangle the systems and study the unitary
circuit game in two different scenarios: with braiding gates, i.e., the
intersection of Clifford gates and matchgates, and with generic matchgates. For
each model, we observe qualitatively different entanglement transitions, which
we characterize both numerically and analytically.

Conclusion: 证明激光并非SPDC产生纠缠的必要条件，为量子技术提供了更实用的纠缠光子源。

Abstract: We experimentally demonstrate a violation of local realism with negligible
spatial postselection on the polarization-entangled two-photon states produced
by spontaneous parametric down-conversion (SPDC) pumped by a spatially
incoherent light source-a light-emitting diode (LED). While existing studies
have observed such a violation only by post-selecting the LED-pumped SPDC into
a single spatial detection mode, we achieve a Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt
inequality violation of $S = 2.532 \pm 0.069 > 2$ using a spatially multimode
detection setup that supports more than 45,000 spatial modes. These results
indicate that coherent pump sources, such as lasers, are not required for
SPDC-based entanglement generation. Our work could enable novel and practical
sources of entangled photons for quantum technologies such as
device-independent quantum key distribution and quantum-enhanced sensing.

Abstract: The last decades have seen the development of quantum machine learning,
stemming from the intersection of quantum computing and machine learning. This
field is particularly promising for the design of alternative quantum (or
quantum inspired) computation paradigms that could require fewer resources with
respect to standard ones, e.g. in terms of energy consumption. In this context,
we present the implementation of a data re-uploading scheme on a photonic
integrated processor, achieving high accuracies in several image classification
tasks. We thoroughly investigate the capabilities of this apparently simple
model, which relies on the evolution of one-qubit states, by providing an
analytical proof that our implementation is a universal classifier and an
effective learner, capable of generalizing to new, unknown data. Hence, our
results not only demonstrate data re-uploading in a potentially
resource-efficient optical implementation but also provide new theoretical
insight into this algorithm, its trainability, and generalizability properties.
This lays the groundwork for developing more resource-efficient machine
learning algorithms, leveraging our scheme as a subroutine.

Abstract: Optically active spin defects in van der Waals (vdW) materials have recently
emerged as versatile quantum sensors, enabling applications from nanoscale
magnetic field detection to the exploration of novel quantum phenomena in
condensed matter systems. Their ease of exfoliation and compatibility with
device integration make them promising candidates for future quantum
technologies. Here we report the observation and room-temperature coherent
control of spin defects in the high-temperature crystalline phase of germanium
disulfide ($\beta$-GeS2), a two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor with low nuclear
spin density. The observed spin defects exhibit spin-1/2 behavior, and their
spin dynamics can be explained by a weakly coupled spin-pair model. We
implement dynamical decoupling techniques to extend the spin coherence time
(T$_2$) by a factor of 20. Finally, we use density functional theory (DFT)
calculations to estimate the structure and spin densities of two possible spin
defect candidates. This work will help expand the field of quantum sensing with
spin defects in van der Waals materials.

Abstract: Europium-doped crystal $\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ is an interesting

$^{151}\mathrm{Eu}^{3+}\!:\mathrm{Y}_2\mathrm{SiO}_5$ under the application of
magnetic field, a complex system with 36 different optical-hyperfine
transitions. We present a simple numerical simulator for calculating the effect
of optical pumping schemes that allow the isolation of a single frequency class
of ions, applicable to any multi-level atom with inhomogeneous broadening.
Experimentally, we develop methodologies for estimating the magnetic field
vector, demonstrating high precision in predicting spectral features based on
the known spin Hamiltonians. We measured the optical Rabi frequency of 21
transitions among the 36 possible optical-hyperfine transitions, allowing for
the construction of a 6x6 branching ratio matrix of relative transition
strengths. From the Rabi frequency measurements, we derive the optical dipole
moment for the $^7\!F_0 \leftrightarrow {}^5\!D_0$ transition, yielding a value
of $(6.94 \pm 0.09) \times 10^{-33}~\mathrm{C} \cdot \mathrm{m}$. Our results
provide a critical test of the spin Hamiltonian models, demonstrating high
precision in predicting energy levels and relative transition strengths, which
are key abilities for quantum applications with

circuits serving as expert models, along with a learnable quantum routing
mechanism that selects and aggregates specialized quantum experts per input.
The empirical results from the proposed QMoE on quantum classification tasks
demonstrate that it consistently outperforms standard quantum neural networks,
highlighting its effectiveness in learning complex data patterns. Our work

Motivation: 目前尚无双最小化PRMI的闭式表达式，因此需要开发数值计算方法来解决这一问题。

Method: 采用交替最小化方法，分别对σ_A和τ_B进行优化，证明了该方法在α∈(1/2,1)∪(1,2]范围内的收敛性。

Result: 对于α∈(1,2]，目标函数值线性收敛；对于α∈(1/2,1)，则次线性收敛。

Conclusion: 该方法适用于任意量子态ρ_AB，扩展了此前仅适用于经典-经典态的研究范围。

Abstract: The doubly minimized Petz Renyi mutual information (PRMI) of order $\alpha$
is defined as the minimization of the Petz divergence of order $\alpha$ of a
fixed bipartite quantum state $\rho_{AB}$ relative to any product state
$\sigma_A\otimes \tau_B$. To date, no closed-form expression for this measure
has been found, necessitating the development of numerical methods for its
computation. In this work, we show that alternating minimization over
$\sigma_A$ and $\tau_B$ asymptotically converges to the doubly minimized PRMI
for any $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)\cup (1,2]$, by proving linear convergence of
the objective function values with respect to the number of iterations for
$\alpha\in (1,2]$ and sublinear convergence for $\alpha\in (\frac{1}{2},1)$.
Previous studies have only addressed the specific case where $\rho_{AB}$ is a
classical-classical state, while our results hold for any quantum state
$\rho_{AB}$.
