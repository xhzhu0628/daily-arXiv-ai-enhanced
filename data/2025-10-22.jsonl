We address this on IBM heavy-hex superconducting processors by\nco-designing the code embedding and control: a depth-minimizing SWAP-based\n\"fold-unfold\" embedding that uses bridge ancillas, together with robust,\ngap-aware dynamical decoupling (DD). On Heron-generation devices we perform\nanisotropic scaling from a uniform distance 3 code to anisotropic distance\n(dx,dz) = (3,5) and (5,3) codes. We find that increasing dz (dx) improves the\nprotection of Z-basis (X-basis) logical states across multiple quantum error\ncorrection cycles. Even if global subthreshold code scaling for arbitrary\nlogical initial states is not yet achieved, we argue that it is within reach\nwith minor hardware improvements. We show that DD plays a major role: it\nsuppresses coherent ZZ crosstalk and non-Markovian dephasing that accumulate\nduring idle gaps on heavy-hex layouts, and it eliminates spurious subthreshold\nclaims that arise when scaled codes without DD are compared against smaller\ncodes with DD. To quantify performance, we derive an entanglement fidelity\nmetric that is computed directly from X- and Z-basis logical-error data and\nprovides per-cycle, SPAM-aware bounds. The entanglement fidelity metric reveals\nthat widely used single-parameter fits used to compute suppression factors can\nmischaracterize or obscure code performance when their assumptions are\nviolated; we identify the strong assumptions of stationarity, unitality, and\nnegligible logical SPAM required for those fits to be valid and show that they\ndo not hold for our data.

This incompatibility is\nquantified by the gap between the symmetric logarithmic derivative (SLD)\nquantum Cram\\'er-Rao bound, which is not always attainable, and the\nasymptotically achievable Holevo bound. This work provides a comprehensive\nanalysis of this gap by introducing and contrasting two scalar measures. The\nfirst is the weight-independent quantumness measure $R$, which captures the\nintrinsic incompatibility of the estimation model. The second is a tighter,\nweight-dependent measure $T[W]$ which explicitly incorporates the cost matrix\n$W$ assigning relative importance to different parameters. We establish a\nhierarchy of bounds based on these two measures and derive necessary and\nsufficient conditions for their saturation. Through analytical and numerical\nstudies of tunable qubit and qutrit models with SU(2) unitary encoding, we\ndemonstrate that the weight-dependent bound $C_{T}[W]$ often provides a\nsignificantly tighter approximation to the Holevo bound $C_{H}[W]$ than the\n$R$-dependent bound, especially in higher-dimensional systems.
