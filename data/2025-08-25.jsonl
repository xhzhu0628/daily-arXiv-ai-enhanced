The first two authors contributed equally to\n  this work", "summary": "Quantum devices comprised of elementary components with more than two stable\nlevels - so-called qudits - enrich the accessible Hilbert space, enabling\napplications ranging from fault-tolerant quantum computing to simulating\ncomplex many-body models. While several quantum platforms are built from local\nelements that are equipped with a rich spectrum of stable energy levels,\nschemes for the efficient control and entanglement of qudits are scarce.\nImportantly, no experimental demonstration of multi-qudit control has been\nachieved to date in neutral atom arrays. Here, we propose a general scheme for\ncontrolling and entangling qudits and perform a full analysis for the case of\nqutrits, encoded in ground and metastable states of alkaline earth atoms. We\nfind an efficient implementation of single-qudit gates via the simultaneous\ndriving of multiple transition frequencies. For entangling operations, we\nprovide a concrete and intuitive recipe for the controlled-Z (CZ) gate for any\nlocal dimension d, realized through alternating single qudit and entangling\npulses that simultaneously drive up to two Rydberg transitions. We further\nprove that two simultaneous Rydberg tones are, in general, the minimum\nnecessary for implementing the CZ gate with a global drive. The pulses we use\nare optimally-controlled, smooth, and robust to realistic experimental\nimperfections, as we demonstrate using extensive noise simulations. This\namounts to a minimal, resource-efficient, and practical protocol for realizing\na universal set of gates. Our scheme for the native control of qudits in a\nneutral atom array provides a high-fidelity route toward qudit-based quantum\ncomputation, ready for implementation on near-term devices."}
