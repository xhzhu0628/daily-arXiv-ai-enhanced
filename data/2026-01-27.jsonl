We demonstrate that any density operator $ρ_{AB}$ of a composite system can be derived from the correlations between two underlying stochastic processes, $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$, representing the random fluctuations of its subsystems. This construction utilizes a two-scale temporal scheme - micro and macro time - where quantum correlations emerge as macro-correlations derived from underlying micro-correlations. We propose the Double Covariance Model (DCM), which reproduces the fundamental properties of quantum theory by treating the quantum state as the fourth-order moment structure of an underlying classical probability space."}

Such descriptions, however, correspond to the singular physical limit of vanishing environmental memory. Here we formulate decoherence using a general time-nonlocal decoherence functional determined solely by the environmental force correlation function, with Markovian dynamics recovered explicitly as a limiting case.\n  For arbitrary stationary environments with finite temporal correlations, we show that the decoherence functional exhibits quadratic short-time growth that is model-independent within the finite-memory class considered. Consequently, the decoherence time defined operationally-without assuming exponential decay-scales as the square root of the environmental correlation time, independent of the detailed form of the bath correlation kernel.\n  These results are illustrated analytically for Gaussian-correlated, soft power-law, and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck environments. In the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck case, the non-Markovian dynamics admit an exact analytical closure, yielding a closed evolution equation for the coherence. Exact numerical simulations based on a pseudomode mapping confirm the predicted scaling and show that exponential decoherence emerges only in the memoryless limit.\n  Beyond coherence decay, we distinguish decoherence rates from observable loss of quantum signatures by analyzing purity and von Neumann entropy dynamics. We show that suppression of a specific coherence element need not coincide with irreversible entropy production. Finally, we introduce an inferred-memory perspective in which the environmental correlation time is treated as an operationally extractable parameter from dynamical data."}

The graybox framework integrates a physics-based system model with a data-driven description of experimental imperfections, achieving higher fidelity than purely analytical (whitebox) approaches while requiring fewer training resources than fully deep-learning models. We experimentally validate the method on the task of estimating a static magnetic field using a single-spin quantum sensor, performing Bayesian inference with a graybox model trained on prior experimental data. Using roughly 10,000 training datapoints, the graybox model yields several orders of magnitude improvement in mean squared error over the corresponding physics-only model.

We focus on a lattice of four spins, where we calculate the ground-state energies, magnetic order parameters and correlation functions at uniformly applied conditions, which is repeated by all systems. Precise diagonalisation provides both a benchmark, which is symmetry-conserving, and a depth-two, physics inspired variational approximation, which provides simulations accessible to hardware.

We find that the ground-state energies of shallow variational circuits are reliably captured by the circuit over the entire parameter space; the magnetic arrangement parameters and observables sensitive to correlation signal significantly more noise. The error analysis of quantitative analysis reveals a strong broadening of critical crossover on hardware, which is consistent with the noise attenuation of long-range correlations.

The performance of SM circuits is therefore critical to the success of a FTQC system.\n  While ultimately implemented as physical circuits, SM circuits have challenges that are not addressed by existing circuit optimization tools. Importantly, inside SM circuits themselves errors are expected to occur, and how errors propagate through SM circuits directly impacts which errors are detectable and correctable, defining the code's logical error rate.

While well-established for static magnetic fluxes, the effect's behavior under time-varying fluxes remains an open and debated question. Employing the WKB method, we derive the AB phase shift for a time-dependent magnetic vector potential, demonstrating that for circular paths in the quasistatic regime, it is proportional to the time-averaged enclosed magnetic flux, \\(Δφ_{\\rm AB} = \\frac{1}{T} \\int_0^T e Φ(t) \\, dt\\), with the total phase shift, including kinetic contributions, equaling \\(e Φ(0)\\). For non-circular paths, the phase shift depends on both the flux history and path geometry, revealing the effect's hybrid nature involving gauge potentials and induced electric fields. We verify the consistency of our gauge choice with Maxwell's equations and discuss the implications for local versus nonlocal interpretations of the AB effect. We also generalize the results to scenarios with nonzero external magnetic fields, where the enclosed flux is through the actual electron paths, and for circular paths of radius $R$, the AB phase shift is also proportional to the time average of the enclosed flux \\(Φ_{\\rm enc}(R,t)\\), with the total phase shift depending only on the initial enclosed flux \\(e Φ_{\\rm enc}(R,0)\\); for general non-circular paths, the external magnetic field affects trajectories and phase accumulation through the Lorentz force, leading to additional path dependence.

We confirm quantum coherence by demonstrating three-photon Rabi oscillations and performing direct Wigner function measurements that reveal three-component cat-like states. We observe breathing-like dynamics in phase space, arising from exotic temporal interference between the qutrit and excited states. The frequency of this interference corresponds to the energy gap between the qutrit and excited manifolds, thereby providing an experimental hallmark of qutrit space protection. We also identify a higher-order pump term as the main mechanism suppressing photon occupation; mitigating this term is necessary to maximize protection.

The algorithm runs in polynomial time and achieves an exponential speedup over both transverse-field quantum annealing and state-of-the-art classical solvers on these instances, under assumptions supported by analytical and numerical evidence. We identify the essential quantum mechanism enabling the speedup as the use of a non-stoquastic XX-driver to access a larger sign-structured admissible subspace beyond the stoquastic regime, which allows sign-generating quantum interference to create smooth evolution paths that bypass tunneling. This identifies a distinctive quantum mechanism underlying the speedup and explains why no efficient classical analogue is likely to exist. In addition, our analysis produces scalable small-scale models, derived from our structural reduction, that capture the essential dynamics of the algorithm.

We show that the multivariate Rényi divergence $D_{\\underlineα}(\\vec{P}_X)$ of probability distributions $\\vec{P}_X =(p^{(0)}_X,\\dots,p^{(d)}_X)$ and real-valued orders $\\underlineα = (α_0, \\dots, α_d)$ quantifies the economic-theoretic value that a rational agent assigns to $d$ lotteries with odds $o^{(k)}_X \\propto (p_X^{(k)})^{-1}$ ($k=1,\\dots,d$) on a random event described by $p^{(0)}_X$. In particular, when the odds are fair and the rational agent maximises over all betting strategies, the economic-theoretic value (the isoelastic certainty equivalent) that the agent assigns to the lotteries is exactly given by $w^{\\mathrm{ICE}}_{\\underline{R}}=\\exp[D_{\\underlineα}(\\vec{P}_X)]$, where $\\underline{R}=(R_1,\\dots,R_d)$ is a risk-aversion vector with $R_k = 1+α_k/α_0$ being the risk-aversion parameter for lottery $k$. Furthermore, we introduce a new conditional multivariate Rényi divergence that characterises a generalised scenario where the agent uses side information. We prove that this new quantity satisfies a data processing inequality which can be interpreted as the increment in the economic-theoretic value provided by side information; crucially, such a data processing inequality is a consequence of the agent's economic-theoretically consistent risk-averse attitude towards every lottery and vice versa. Finally, we apply these results to the resource theory of informative measurements in general probabilistic theories (GPTs). By establishing quantitative connections between information theory, physics, and economics, our framework provides a novel operational foundation for quantum state betting games with multiple lotteries in the realm of quantum resource theories."}

However, practical implementations face severe degradation of both metrics due to unavoidable losses, representing the foremost challenge in advancing quantum interferometry toward real-world applications. To address this challenge, we propose a coherent-amplifier-empowered quantum interferometer. The coherent amplifier dramatically suppresses the decay of both sensitivity and quantum enhancement under high-loss conditions, maintaining phase sensitivity beyond the original SQL even for losses exceeding 90%. Using an injected 4.2 dB squeezed-vacuum state in experimental demonstration, our scheme reduces the quantum enhancement degradation under 90% loss from 3.7 dB in a conventional quantum interferometer (CQI) to only 1.5 dB. More importantly, the phase sensitivity degradation under the same loss is limited to 4.0 dB, markedly outperforming the 11.2 dB degradation observed in a CQI. This improvement is enabled by the coherent amplifier's phase-sensitive photon amplification and its protection of the quantum state. This breakthrough in amplifier-empowered quantum interferometry overcomes the critical barrier to practical deployment, enabling robust quantum-enhanced measurements in lossy environments."}

Typical QKD security proofs are carried out in an idealized setting where authentication is assumed to behave honestly: it never aborts, and all classical messages are delivered faithfully with their original timing preserved. Authenticated channels that can be constructed in practice have different properties. Most critically, such channels may abort asymmetrically, such that only the receiving party may detect an authentication failure while the sending party remains unaware. Furthermore, an adversary may delay, reorder, or block classical messages. This discrepancy renders the standard QKD security definition and existing QKD security proofs invalid in the practical authentication setting. In this work we resolve this issue. Our main result is a reduction theorem showing that, under mild and easily satisfied protocol conditions, any QKD protocol proven secure under the honest authentication setting remains secure under a practical authentication setting. This result allows all existing QKD proofs to be retroactively lifted to the practical authentication setting with a minor protocol tweak."}

Random Hamiltonians drawn from the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble generate stochastic unitary dynamics of the quantum state, while equivalence classes reflecting finite detector resolution define classical observables as well as classical configuration-space and phase-space submanifolds. When the evolution is constrained to the phase-space submanifold, free Schrödinger dynamics reduces to Newtonian motion, while stochastic motion constrained to the classical configuration-space submanifold yields ordinary Brownian motion in classical space. Transition probabilities under the stochastic dynamics satisfy the Born rule, whereas the constrained classical evolution produces the normal probability distributions characteristic of classical measurements. We show that, in this setting, measurement, state reduction, and the quantum-classical transition emerge from unitary dynamics alone, without invoking nonunitary collapse or additional postulates. Entanglement and EPR correlations arise geometrically from the evolution of joint states in composite state space, preserving locality in spacetime. The framework provides a unified dynamical account of measurement and classicality compatible with the structure of quantum mechanics."}

Rewriting the sine series in terms of complex exponentials, then evaluating it on the Hermitian and anti-Hermitian parts of a non-unitary operator, yields its approximation by a linear combination of unitaries. When implemented in a quantum circuit, the subnormalisation of the resulting block encoding scales with the double logarithm of the inverse error, substantially improving over the polynomial relationship in existing methods. For hardware or applications with a fixed error budget, we discuss a strategy to minimise subnormalisation by exploiting the overcomplete nature of the Fourier extension basis. This regularisation procedure traces an error-subnormalisation Pareto front, identifying coefficients that maximise the subnormalisation at a fixed error budget. Fourier linear combinations of unitaries thus provides an accurate and versatile framework for non-unitary quantum computing."}

To overcome the barren plateau problem, we introduce a two-stage optimization framework. First comes the convex initialization stage. Here, we shape the quantum energy landscape, the Hilmaton landscape, into a smooth, low-energy basin. This step makes gradients easier to spot and keeps noise from derailing the process. Once we have gotten a stable gradient flow, we move to the second stage: nonconvex refinement. In this phase, we allow the algorithm to explore different energy minima, thereby making the model more expressive.

However, its performance is often limited by the overhead of additional qubits required for embedding logical QUBO models onto quantum annealers. This overhead becomes severe when logical QUBO models have dense connectivity. Such dense structures frequently arise when formulating equality and inequality constraints. To address this issue, we propose a method to construct a significantly sparser logical QUBO model for these constraints. By adding auxiliary variables based on specific network structures, our approach decomposes the original constraint into smaller, more manageable constraints. We demonstrate that this method reduces the number of edges (quadratic terms) from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ for the one-hot constraint and to $O(N\\log N)$ in the worst case for general equality constraints, where $N$ is the number of variables. Experimental results on D-Wave's hardware show that our formulation leads to substantial reductions in the number of qubits required for embedding, shorter average chain lengths, lower chain break rates, and higher feasible solution rates compared to conventional methods.

This method is also more resource-efficient than the correlation spectroscopy, as for the same detection accuracy with $N$ sampling times, it takes total detection time $O(N)$ while the latter one takes time $O(N^2)$. We numerically demonstrate this method for both bosonic and spin baths."}

Nevertheless, the implementation of QET is severely impeded by the fundamental locality of gapped many-body systems, where the exponential clustering of ground-state correlations restricts energy extraction to microscopic scales. In this work, we address this scalability crisis within the framework of the one-dimensional anisotropic XY model. We initially provide a rigorous characterization of a monolithic measurement-induced strategy, demonstrating that while bulk projective measurements can theoretically induce long-range couplings, the approach is rendered physically untenable by exponentially diverging thermodynamic costs and vanishing success probabilities. To circumvent this impasse, we propose and analyze a hierarchical quantum repeater architecture adapted for energy teleportation. By orchestrating heralded entanglement generation, iterative entanglement purification, and nested entanglement swapping, our protocol effectively counteracts the fidelity degradation inherent in noisy quantum channels. We establish that this architecture fundamentally alters the operational resource scaling from exponential to polynomial. This proves, for the first time, the physical permissibility and computational tractability of activating vacuum energy at arbitrary distances. The significance lies not in net energy gain, but in establishing long-range QET as a viable protocol for remote quantum control and resource distribution."}

Here, we report a new protocol that records the photocurrent via heterodyne mixing with a stable local oscillator. The obtained complex quadrature amplitude that carries information imprinted on its phase by an external magnetic field, is successfully recovered from the interference patterns between the light and the atomic spin wave, without the stringent requirement of having them overlap in time.

Submitted to IEEE JSAC", "summary": "Leveraging the quantum advantages of highly excited atoms, Rydberg atomic receivers (RAREs) represent a paradigm shift in radio wave detection, offering high sensitivity and broadband reception. However, existing studies largely model RAREs as isotropic point receivers and overlook the spatial variations of atomic quantum states within vapor cells, thus inaccurately characterizing their reception patterns. To address this issue, we present a theoretical analysis of the aforementioned spatial responses of a standard local-oscillator (LO)- dressed RARE. Our results reveal that increasing the vapor-cell length produces a receive beam aligned with the LO field, with a beamwidth inversely proportional to the cell length. This finding enables atomic beamforming to enhance received signal-to-noise ratio using only a single-antenna RARE. Furthermore, we derive the achievable beamforming gain by characterizing and balancing the fundamental tradeoff between the effects of increasing the vapor cell length and the exponential power decay of laser propagating through the cell. To overcome the limitation imposed by exponential decay, we propose a novel RARE architecture termed segmental vapor cell. This architecture consists of vapor-cell segments separated by clear-air gaps, allowing the total cell length (and hence propagation loss) to remain fixed while the effective cell length increases. As a result, this segmented design expands the effective atom-field interaction area without increasing the total vapor cell length, yielding a narrower beamwidth and thus higher beamforming gain as compared with a traditional continuous vapor cell."}

Bridging these gaps, this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Hybrid Quantum-Classical Dispatching (PI-HQCD) framework. We construct a topology-aware Hamiltonian that explicitly embeds linearized power flow equations, storage dynamics, and multi-timescale coupling directly into the quantum substrate, significantly reducing the search space dimensionality. We further derive a noise-adaptive regularization mechanism that theoretically bounds the effective Lipschitz constant of the objective function, guaranteeing convergence stability under realistic quantum measurement noise. Numerical experiments on the IEEE 39-bus benchmark and a 118-bus regional grid demonstrate that PI-HQCD achieves superior economic efficiency and higher renewable utilization compared to stochastic dual dynamic programming (SDDP). Theoretical analysis confirms that this topology-aware design leads to an O(1/N) gradient variance scaling, effectively mitigating barren plateaus and ensuring scalability for larger networks.

However, such an approach still does not account for finite-shot effects or for quantum error mitigation (QEM), a key near-term error suppression strategy that reduces estimation bias at the cost of increased sampling overhead. We address this limitation by developing a benchmarking framework that explicitly incorporates finite-shot statistics and the resource overhead induced by QEM. Our framework quantifies quantum advantage through the confidence that an estimated energy lies within an interval defined by the best-known classical upper and lower bounds. Using a proof-of-principle numerical study of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model at size $8\\times8$, we demonstrate that the framework effectively identifies noise and shot-budget regimes in which the probabilistic error cancellation (PEC), a representative QEM method, is operationally advantageous, and potential quantum advantage is not hindered by finite-shot effects.

We also demonstrate the effectiveness of these decompositions on the Heisenberg model and the quantum harmonic oscillator, and find that for a fixed final time they perform better across the computational cost. Even when using large time steps, they surpass established low-order schemes like the Leapfrog. Finally, we investigate the in-practice performance of different Trotter schemes and find the decompositions with more uniform coefficients tend to feature improved error accumulation over long times. We have included this observation into our choice of recommended schemes."}

However, non-unitary operations can also be implemented through block encodings, where additional ancilla qubits are introduced and later measured. While block encoding has a number of well-established theoretical applications, its practical implementation has been prohibitively expensive for current quantum hardware. In this paper, we present practical and explicit block encoding circuits implementing matrix polynomial transformations of a target matrix. With standard approaches, block-encoding a degree-$d$ matrix polynomial requires a circuit depth scaling as $d$ times the depth for block-encoding the original matrix alone. By leveraging the recently introduced Fast One-Qubit Controlled Select LCU (FOQCS-LCU) framework, we show that the additional circuit-depth overhead required for encoding matrix polynomials can be reduced to scale linearly in $d$ with no dependence on system size or the cost of block encoding the original matrix. Moreover, we demonstrate that the FOQCS-LCU circuits and their associated matrix polynomial transformations can be controlled with negligible overhead, enabling efficient applications such as Hadamard tests. Finally, we provide explicit circuits for representative spin models, together with detailed non-asymptotic gate counts and circuit depths."}

We show that, given access to an appropriate decoding oracle, there exist efficient quantum algorithms for preparing the state $ρ_{\\mathcal P}(H) = \\frac{\\mathcal P^2(H)}{\\text{Tr}[\\mathcal P^2(H)]}$, where $\\mathcal P(H)$ denotes the matrix function induced by a univariate polynomial $\\mathcal P(x)$. Such states can be used to approximate the Gibbs states of $H$ for suitable choices of polynomials. We further demonstrate that the proposed algorithms are robust to imperfections in the decoding procedure. Our results substantially extend the scope of HDQI beyond stabilizer-like Hamiltonians, providing a method for Gibbs-state preparation and Hamiltonian optimization in a broad class of physically and computationally relevant quantum systems."}
