Cultivation protocols involve measuring a\ntransversal logical Clifford operator on an initial small-distance code and\nthen rapidly growing to a larger-distance code. In this work, we present a new\ncultivation scheme in which we measure the fold-transversal Hadamard of the\nunrotated surface code, and leverage unitary techniques to grow within the\nsurface code family. Using both stabilizer and state vector simulations we find\nthat this approach achieves the lowest known spacetime overhead for magic state\ncultivation. Practical implementation of our protocol is best suited to\narchitectures with non-local connectivity, showing the strength of\narchitectures where such connectivity is readily available."}

In \\emph{Entanglement in Directed Graph States}, (2025),\narXiv:2505.10716, it is demonstrated that the vertex degree distribution fully\ndetermines this entanglement measure and remains invariant under vertex\nrelabeling, highlighting its topological character. As a consequence, the\nmeasure depends only on the total degree of each vertex, making it independent\nof the distinction between incoming and outgoing edges. We apply our framework\nto several specific graph structures, including hierarchical networks, neural\nnetwork-inspired graphs, full binary tree and linear bridged cycle graphs,\ndemonstrating how their combinatorial properties influence entanglement\ndistribution.

It has generally been assumed that preparing high-fidelity T\nstates requires noisy injection of T states followed by lengthy distillation\nroutines. This assumption has been recently challenged by the introduction of\ncultivation, in which careful state injection and postselection alone are used\nto prepare T states close to the fidelity required for quantum algorithms.\nCultivation was originally proposed for the color code, but can also be done on\nthe $RP^2$ code, a code similar to the surface code.\n  In this work, we demonstrate how to cultivate T states directly on the\nsurface code. Besides its simplicity compared to color or $RP^2$ cultivation,\nsurface code cultivation offers a number of advantages, including: (1) It is\nmore directly compatible with neutral atom architectures than ${RP}^2$\ncultivation (2) Cultivated surface code states can be used in transversal CNOT\ngates with other surface codes, unlike color code states (3) Surface code\ncultivation can be done at any distance, unlike color and ${RP}^2$ cultivation\nwhich requires odd distances. Under a standard depolarizing error model, our\n$d=3,\\ (4),\\ (5)$ cultivation circuit reaches an error rate of $1\\cdot\n10^{-6},\\ (1\\cdot10^{-8}),\\ (2\\cdot10^{-9})$ and an acceptance rate of $34\\%,\\\n(6\\%),\\ (1\\%)$, meeting or exceeding the fidelity of color and $RP^2$\ncultivation with comparable acceptance rates."}

Despite the large literature around variational approaches to\nquantum computing, the answer is largely unknown. We address this open question\nby developing a convergence theory for the variational quantum eigensolver\n(VQE). By leveraging the terminology of quantum control landscapes, we prove a\nsufficient criterion that characterizes when convergence to a ground state of a\nHamiltonian can be guaranteed for almost all initial parameter settings. More\nspecifically, we show that if (i) a parameterized unitary transformation allows\nfor moving in all tangent-space directions (local surjectivity) in a bounded\nmanner and (ii) the gradient descent used for the parameter update terminates,\nthen the VQE converges to a ground state almost surely. We develop\nconstructions that satisfy both aspects of condition (i) and analyze two\ncommonly employed families of quantum circuit ans\\\"atze. Finally, we discuss\nregularization techniques for guaranteeing gradient descent to terminate, as\nfor condition (ii), and draw connections to the halting problem."}
